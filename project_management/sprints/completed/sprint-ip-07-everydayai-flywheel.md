# Sprint IP-07 — EverydayAI Bridge + Community-to-Commercial Flywheel

## Goal
Formalize the EverydayAI Newark initiative as a structured Studio Ordo program, documenting the community-to-commercial flywheel that uses free community training to generate corporate leads and apprentice candidates.

## Why This Sprint
Keith's EverydayAI Newark project (free 4-week community training, corporate packages, career bridge) is already designed in the BSEAI project but has no presence in the LMS business folder. This is the growth engine: free community programs build reputation and pipeline; corporate training generates revenue; apprentice graduates come from the community.

### 3. `business/studio-ordo/community/flywheel-model.md`
Document the community-to-commercial flywheel:
```
Free Community Training (EverydayAI)
    → reputation + local awareness
    → community graduates discover Studio Ordo
    → some become apprentice candidates
    → some refer corporate contacts
    ↓
Corporate Training (Paid Packages)
    → revenue funds community programs
    → corporate participants see apprentice quality
    → some hire apprentices directly
    ↓
Apprenticeship Pipeline
    → apprentices gain experience through deals
    → experienced apprentices lead community training
    → completing the cycle
```
- Revenue projections: Year 1 conservative $35K, scaling $100K+
- Key metrics: community participants, corporate conversions, apprentice placements
- Partnership model: NJIT + Newark community centers + corporate partners

### 5. `business/studio-ordo/community/town-hall-series.md`

## Adaptation Rules
- EverydayAI is a Studio Ordo program, not a university program
- Keith's role: founder/director, not professor
- Community programs are genuinely free (not "free trial")
- Corporate packages have clear, published pricing (union pricing philosophy)
- Revenue model is transparent: "corporate training funds free community programs"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] EverydayAI program fully specified (4-week format, materials, logistics)
- [ ] 3 corporate packages defined with pricing and deliverables
- [ ] Flywheel model documented with revenue projections
- [ ] Career Bridge program documented
- [ ] Town Hall series format defined
- [ ] All programs connect to LMS systems (events, registrations, newsletter)
- [ ] Revenue model articulated clearly

## Exit Gate
Community programs are specified enough to launch the first cohort.
