# Sprint 28: Homepage — UX Design

> **Goal:** Two doors. Someone arrives at the homepage. Before they scroll, they know what Studio Ordo does and which door is theirs. One click. Gone.

**Heading:** `"Bring order to AI in software delivery."`
**Subhead:** Two sentences:
- Sentence 1: `"We build software products for engineering teams."`
- Sentence 2: `"We train the directors who lead them."`

**Tile layout:**
- Two equal-weight tiles side by side (stacked on mobile)
- Tile 1: `"Commission a project →"` → `/studio`
- Tile 2: `"Enroll in Maestro →"` → `/maestro`
- No icon imagery in the tiles — copy only
- `"23 years teaching engineers · 10,000+ students"` below tiles, centered, `type-meta text-text-muted`

## What's Removed

| Item | Where It Is Now | After Sprint 28 |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Section 03 — Canon 3-card block | Below hero, homepage | Gone |
| Section 04 — 90-Day Transformation | Homepage | Gone |

---

## What Remains After Removal

After removing Sections 03 and 04, the homepage should have:
1. Hero (two tiles, proof point)
2. Any remaining sections that are buyer/learner neutral — keep anything that works for both audiences

If removing Sections 03 and 04 leaves the page feeling sparse, that is correct. The homepage is a router, not a brochure.
