# Sprint IP-06 — Marketing Copy + Lead Magnets + Landing Page Content

## Goal
Package the most commercially compelling BSEAI content into marketing copy, lead magnets, and landing page content for Studio Ordo's public-facing pages.

## Why This Sprint
The BSEAI project contains the best sales arguments already written — salary data, urgency thesis, competitive differentiation, the "CEO of agents" positioning, and the Human Edge framework. This sprint turns that research into ready-to-deploy marketing assets.

## Source Material
- All IP documents created in IP-01 through IP-05
- BSEAI career data, acceleration thesis, industry voices
- Existing Studio Ordo brand guide, messaging guide, voice-tone guide
- Current homepage content (5 Swiss-style sections)
