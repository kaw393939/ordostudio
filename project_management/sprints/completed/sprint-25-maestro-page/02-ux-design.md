# Sprint 25: `/maestro` Page — UX Design

> **Voice:** Sage-to-Sage. The visitor is a domain expert. Do not instruct them. Present the operating model as a peer would.
> **Swiss constraint:** ≤3 type roles per section. No decorative elements.
> **Krug constraint:** One primary action per viewport-worth of content.

*"Direct the machine" uses the approved Studio Ordo verb system — same language as the homepage hero. "Build the practice" is the outcome, stated plainly. No question mark in the close CTA — a command, not a prompt.*

## 2. Who This Is For

```
Who this is for

You have deep expertise. The AI era doesn't make it obsolete —
it makes it more valuable, if you know how to apply it.
```

*Two sentences. Period. No "Are you a senior engineer who..." No nested clauses. The visitor either recognises themselves or doesn't. We describe them accurately; we don't recruit.*

---

## 3. The Checklist

Five items. Plain list — no grid, no columns, no numbers.

```
What you get:

✔  8-week cohort program — structured, not open-ended
✔  Context Pack operating model applied to your domain
✔  Guild structure and the franchise system
✔  Your expertise translated to agentic workflows
✔  Revenue share from the first engagement
```

*No item is a superlative. Every item is a tangible deliverable or a structural fact. "Revenue share from the first engagement" is the Reciprocity signal: Studio invests in the practitioner's success.*

## 4. Choose Your Format

Two cards.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Cohort program                 │  │  Advisory retainer               │
│                                 │  │                                  │
│  $3,000 – $5,000                │  │  $1,500 – $2,500 / month         │
│                                 │  │                                  │
│  8-week, cohort-based.          │  │  Ongoing 1:1. Applied to your    │
│  Limited by Maestro capacity.   │  │  active work, not alongside it.  │
│                                 │  │                                  │

└─────────────────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

*Pricing is stated plainly — no "starting from", no "contact us for pricing" unless advisory pricing is genuinely variable. The format cards are parallel: same CTA, different `?source` param. No "most popular" badge — that's manufactured social proof.*

## 5. Questions We Get (FAQ)

Headline: **"Questions we get."** (not "Common questions." — that's a label, not a headline)

```
Do I need to be an engineer?
No. Judgment and domain expertise matter more than syntax. If you
can spec a system and evaluate whether it works, you're the target.

What's the time commitment?
4–6 hours per week. The cohort is structured with defined deliverables,
not an open-ended advisory.

When does the next cohort start?
Book a discovery call and we'll confirm dates. Cohort size is limited
by Maestro capacity — we do not run open enrollment.

What's the revenue share on guild work?
You keep 80% of project revenue on work referred through the Guild.
Studio Ordo retains 20% as the operating platform.
```

*Every answer leads with the direct response. No restatement of the question. No "Great question!" No trailing clauses after the real point is made.*

## 6. Close

```
Built with the method.

The 40/60 Method — the same ratio we teach — runs every Studio Ordo
project. The training and the work are the same thing.

[Book your discovery call.]          → BOOKING_URL
[Read the framework →]               → /insights
```

*Headline is a statement, not a question. It signals authenticity: the teacher uses the method. Secondary CTA routes curious visitors to `/insights` — not a dead end.*
