# Sprint 24: Bottega Model Public Content Update

## 1. Problem Statement
The public-facing website (specifically the About and Studio pages) currently reflects an outdated 12-18 month apprenticeship model. It needs to be updated to reflect the new "Modern Software Bottega" model, which clarifies the business engine, the ethical firewall, and the decentralized sales strategy.

## 2. Objectives
- Update the About page to introduce John as the Journeyman/Partner and clarify Keith's role as the Maestro.
- Update the Studio page to define the four roles of the Bottega model: Maestro, Journeyman, Apprentice, and Affiliate.
- Clearly communicate the "zero obligation" independent contractor relationship with graduates.
- Highlight the high-commission affiliate network as the primary growth engine.

## 3. Scope of Work

### Epic 1: About Page Updates (`src/app/(public)/about/page.tsx`)
- **Task 1.1**: Update Keith Williams' bio to reflect the "Maestro" role—setting the architectural vision and acting as the final quality gate, without managing daily trainee execution.
- **Task 1.2**: Add John's bio as the "Journeyman" and operational bridge. Highlight his MS in Data Science from NJIT, his early adoption of agentic coding tools, and his shipped projects in production.
- **Task 1.3**: Frame the company explicitly as a "Modern Software Bottega."

### Epic 2: Studio Page Updates (`src/app/(public)/studio/page.tsx`)
- **Task 2.1**: Replace the "Four Levels" (Apprentice, Journeyman, Senior Journeyman, Maestro Candidate) with the Bottega Hierarchy: Maestro, Journeyman, Apprentice, Affiliate.
- **Task 2.2**: Define the Affiliate role and the high-commission structure (15-20%) for generating leads.
- **Task 2.3**: Define the Apprentice role as an independent contractor who executes the 40/60 split under the Journeyman's supervision.
- **Task 2.4**: Explicitly state the "zero obligation" policy—Studio Ordo is a guild that assigns overflow work to the best graduates, not a bootcamp that promises jobs.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The About page includes John's bio and frames the company as a Bottega.
- [x] The Studio page accurately describes the Maestro, Journeyman, Apprentice, and Affiliate roles.
- [x] The commission structure and independent contractor status are clearly communicated.
- [x] All changes adhere to the Swiss/Bauhaus design system and typography rules.

## 5. Out of Scope
- Changes to the core curriculum or LMS platform features.
- Updates to the `HomeHero` or `page.tsx` (completed in previous sprint).
