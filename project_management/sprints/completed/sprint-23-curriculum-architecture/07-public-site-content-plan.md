## Public Site Content Plan (Replacing Generated Content)

The current public-facing site contains placeholder or AI-generated content that does not reflect the new 90-day "Tech / Liberal Arts Crash Course" curriculum or the "CEO of Agents" philosophy. This plan outlines the strategy for replacing all generated content with realistic, high-signal copy that aligns with the new business documents.

### 1. The Homepage (The Hook)
*   **Current State:** Generic "learn to code" or apprenticeship messaging.
*   **New Content:** The "Double Stripping" thesis. The headline must immediately communicate that AI is commoditizing syntax, and the only remaining value is judgment.
*   **Action:** Draft a new hero section, value proposition (the 40/60 split), and a clear call to action for the 90-day transformation.

### 2. The Curriculum Page (The 12-Week Campaign)
*   **Current State:** An 18-month, sprawling syllabus.
*   **New Content:** A concise, high-impact breakdown of the three phases: The Foundation (Order & Logic), The Director (Taste & Architecture), and The Maestro (Rhetoric, Responsibility, & Sales).
*   **Action:** Translate the `03-weekly-outlines.md` into public-facing marketing copy that emphasizes the philosophical and technical integration (Action-First Integration).

### 3. The Philosophy/About Page (The "Why")
*   **Current State:** Standard "about us" copy.
*   **New Content:** The BSEAI "Letter from the AI" concepts. The necessity of the Verification Toolchain, the concept of the "Alien Mind," and the ultimate goal of training engineers who have **stakes**.
*   **Action:** Draft a manifesto-style page that clearly articulates the Studio Ordo worldview (The Outlaw archetype disrupting the standard tech education model).

### 4. The Studio Ordo Guild Page (The Endgame)
*   **Current State:** Non-existent or vague.
*   **New Content:** Explain the "Teaching Hospital" model. How graduates transition into Associates, the NYC Meetup Strategy, and the ethical firewall between the academy and the commercial firm.
*   **Action:** Draft copy that positions Studio Ordo as an elite guild for Product Engineers.

### 5. Testimonials & Proof (The Reality Check)
*   **Current State:** Placeholder names and quotes.
*   **New Content:** Realistic (even if currently simulated for development) profiles of working professionals who have undergone the 90-day transformation.
*   **Action:** Create detailed, realistic personas (e.g., a mid-level React developer who realized they were being automated and pivoted to AI governance) to serve as proof points until real student data is available.
