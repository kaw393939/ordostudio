## The Process: How We Build the Curriculum

To ensure we end up with a rigorous, cohesive, and actionable 90-day curriculum, we will follow a structured process similar to our software development sprints. We will treat the curriculum as a product, with clear specifications, user experience (learner experience) design, and task breakdowns.

### Phase 1: The Core Philosophy & Architecture (The "Spec")
*   **Goal:** Define the "Why" and the "What."
*   **Action:** We will draft `01-curriculum-spec.md`. This document will outline the pedagogical philosophy (integrating tech and liberal arts), the target audience (professionals), the core themes (Logic, Taste, Rhetoric), and the overarching learning objectives.
*   **Key Question:** What is the exact transformation we are promising in 90 days?

### Phase 2: The Learner Experience (The "UX Design")
*   **Goal:** Define the "How." How does a student experience a week in this program?
*   **Action:** We will draft `02-learner-experience.md`. This will detail the weekly cadence, balancing active learning (coding, building), reflection (journaling, defending decisions), and passive consumption (reading, watching). We will map out how we integrate tools like Git, VSCode, and Python seamlessly into the philosophical lessons.
*   **Key Question:** How do we ensure they are learning Git while studying Stoicism, without it feeling disjointed?

### Phase 3: The Content Outlines (The "Sprint Tasks")
*   **Goal:** Break down the 12 weeks into actionable content blocks.
*   **Action:** We will draft `03-weekly-outlines.md`. This will be the detailed syllabus. For each week, we will define:
    *   The Philosophical Theme (e.g., "Control vs. Influence")
    *   The Technical Focus (e.g., "Version Control & State Management")
    *   The Required Reading/Media (e.g., Excerpts from *Meditations*, a specific museum exhibit analysis)
    *   The Weekly Project/Artifact (e.g., "Build a state machine in Python and defend its architecture")
*   **Key Question:** What are the specific, tangible artifacts they must produce each week to prove their judgment?

### Phase 4: The Reading List & Resources (The "Assets")
*   **Goal:** Curate the highest-quality inputs for the students.
*   **Action:** We will draft `04-reading-list.md`. This will be a curated list of contemporary information, classical texts, art, and cultural references that support the curriculum. We will focus on the *messages* of figures like Aurelius, Peterson (responsibility/order), and Huberman (biological discipline/focus) without getting bogged down in the personalities.
*   **Key Question:** What are the essential texts and media that will rewire their thinking?

### Phase 5: Platform Requirements (The "Infrastructure")
*   **Goal:** Identify what changes the LMS needs to support this new model.
*   **Action:** We will draft `05-platform-requirements.md`. This will list any new features needed (e.g., a new type of submission for the "Manifesto," integration of reflection journals, changes to the `/studio` page to reflect the 90-day timeline).
*   **Key Question:** Does our current platform support this new pedagogical model?

## Next Steps

If you agree with this process, our immediate next step is to start drafting **Phase 5: Platform Requirements (`05-platform-requirements.md`)**. We will list any new features needed in the LMS platform to support this new curriculum structure.

Shall we begin drafting the platform requirements?
