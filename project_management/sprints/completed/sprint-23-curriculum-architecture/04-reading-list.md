## The Canon (The Reading List & Resources)

This document outlines the curated reading list and media resources for the 90-day curriculum. It operates on the **10% Rule**: we do not assign 400-page books. We extract the top 10% of insights from the top 10 thinkers that yield 80% of the results. The goal is high-signal, actionable philosophy that directly informs engineering and product decisions.

The Canon is divided into three core categories, mirroring the phases of the curriculum: Order & Logic, Taste & Architecture, and Rhetoric & Responsibility.

### Category 1: Order, Logic, and The Baseline (Weeks 1-4)

**Focus:** Establishing biological discipline, understanding the dichotomy of control, and managing entropy.

1.  **Marcus Aurelius — *Meditations* (Excerpts)**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The Dichotomy of Control. You cannot control the market, the AI's hallucinations, or the client's demands. You can only control your architecture, your tests, and your response.
    *   **Application:** Taught alongside Git and state management.
2.  **Andrew Huberman — *Huberman Lab Podcast* (Curated Clips)**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** Biological discipline precedes cognitive discipline. Sleep, light exposure, and dopamine regulation are prerequisites for deep work, not self-help.
    *   **Application:** Taught as the "Operating Baseline" in Week 1.
3.  **Jordan Peterson — *12 Rules for Life* (Excerpts on Order/Chaos)**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The boundary between order and chaos. Engineering is the act of imposing order on chaotic systems.
    *   **Application:** Taught alongside version control and reverting chaos.
4.  **Claude Shannon — *A Mathematical Theory of Communication* (Summary)**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** Signal vs. Noise. The fundamental concept of information theory and how to communicate unambiguously.
    *   **Application:** Taught alongside strict typing (Python/TypeScript) and clear prompt engineering.
5.  **The BSEAI "Letter from the AI"**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The "Double Stripping" and the concept that "A human being is for having stakes."
    *   **Application:** The foundational text for understanding the role of the Product Engineer.

### Category 2: Taste, Architecture, and The Alien Mind (Weeks 5-8)

**Focus:** Governing AI, understanding cognitive load, and designing resilient systems.

1.  **Steve Krug — *Don't Make Me Think***
    *   **The 10% Insight:** Cognitive load is the enemy of user experience. Every unnecessary element drains the user's limited attention.
    *   **Application:** Taught alongside UI/UX design and critiquing AI-generated frontends.
2.  **Edward Tufte — *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* (Excerpts)**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The Data-Ink Ratio. Maximize the proportion of ink used to present data; erase non-data-ink.
    *   **Application:** Applied to dashboard design and API response structures.
3.  **The Bauhaus Movement & Vitruvius**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** Form follows function (Bauhaus). *Firmitas, Utilitas, Venustas* (Durability, Utility, Beauty - Vitruvius).
    *   **Application:** Taught alongside system architecture and database design.
4.  **The 12-Factor App Methodology**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The gold standard for building scalable, resilient, and portable web applications.
    *   **Application:** Used as the rubric for the Automated Audit of the student's architecture.
5.  **Atul Gawande — *The Checklist Manifesto***
    *   **The 10% Insight:** Epistemic humility. Even experts fail under complexity. Checklists (and automated audits) save lives and systems.
    *   **Application:** Taught alongside the Automated Audit and Escalation Loop.

### Category 3: Rhetoric, Responsibility, and Sales (Weeks 9-12)

**Focus:** Translating technical value, persuasion, and the mechanics of influence.

1.  **Robert Cialdini — *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion***
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The six principles of persuasion (Reciprocity, Commitment/Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity).
    *   **Application:** Used to rewrite READMEs, marketing copy, and the final Capstone pitch.
2.  **Margaret Mark & Carol S. Pearson — *The Hero and the Outlaw***
    *   **The 10% Insight:** Brand Archetypes. People don't buy features; they buy meaning. How to position a product (or yourself) in a crowded market.
    *   **Application:** Used to define the positioning for the Capstone project and the student's personal brand for the NYC Meetups.
3.  **Aristotle — *Rhetoric* (Summary of Ethos, Pathos, Logos)**
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The triad of persuasion. You need credibility (Ethos), emotional connection (Pathos), and logical argument (Logos) to sell an idea.
    *   **Application:** The framework for the 60-second elevator pitch.
4.  **Studio Ordo — *Governance & Handbook***
    *   **The 10% Insight:** The rules of engagement for the guild. The ethical firewall, the standard of quality, and the expectations of an Associate.
    *   **Application:** The final reading before the NYC Meetup Strategy execution.
