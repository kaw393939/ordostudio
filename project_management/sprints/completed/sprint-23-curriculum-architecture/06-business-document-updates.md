## Business Document Updates

The shift from an 18-month apprenticeship to a 90-day "Tech / Liberal Arts Crash Course" for working professionals requires a comprehensive update of our core business documents. The new philosophy ("CEO of Agents," the "Double Stripping," and the NYC Meetup Strategy) must be reflected across all brand and operational materials.

### 1. `business/studio-ordo/brand-guide.md`
*   **Update:** Shift the target audience from "aspiring coders" to "working professionals/engineers."
*   **Update:** Emphasize the "Product Engineer" and "CEO of Agents" positioning.
*   **Update:** Integrate the "Double Stripping" thesis as the core problem we solve.

### 2. `business/studio-ordo/messaging-guide.md`
*   **Update:** Revise the core messaging pillars to focus on judgment, semantics, and product vision over syntax and execution.
*   **Update:** Incorporate the language of the "Alien Mind" (LLMs rationalize, they do not reason) and the necessity of the Verification Toolchain.
*   **Update:** Add messaging specific to the NYC Meetup Strategy (how Associates pitch Studio Ordo).

### 3. `business/studio-ordo/personas.md`
*   **Update:** Redefine the primary persona. They are no longer someone looking for their first coding job; they are an engineer or professional who realizes their procedural skills are being commoditized and needs to learn how to govern AI.

### 4. `business/studio-ordo/influence-strategy.md`
*   **Update:** Explicitly map Cialdini's principles and the Brand Archetypes (Hero/Outlaw) to the new 90-day curriculum and the NYC Meetup infiltration strategy.

### 5. `business/studio-ordo/web-homepage-system.md`
*   **Update:** The homepage must immediately communicate the 90-day transformation, the 40/60 split (manual vs. agentic work), and the "CEO of Agents" philosophy. The value proposition is no longer "learn to code," but "learn to direct the machine."
