# Sprint 23 — Curriculum Architecture: The 90-Day Transformation

Sprint: 23
Focus: Curriculum Architecture & Content Outlines
Date: 2026-02-24
Status: **Planning**

## Scope

This sprint defines the architecture and content outlines for the new 90-day "Tech / Liberal Arts Crash Course" curriculum. This curriculum replaces the 18-month apprenticeship model with a high-intensity, 12-week cognitive rewiring program designed to teach engineers how to direct AI systems using logic, taste, and judgment.

The core thesis: **AI is commoditizing syntax and execution. The only remaining value is in semantics, product vision, and judgment.** We are not training coders; we are training **Product Engineers** who know how to ask the right questions, define the right problems, and govern the AI that writes the code. This aligns with the "CEO of agents" philosophy: the engineer's job is no longer to write the code, but to manage the AI that writes the code, evaluate its output, and take responsibility for the final product.

Furthermore, because execution is now cheap, **every engineer must become a business owner and a salesperson.** If you can build a product in a weekend with AI, the bottleneck is no longer building it; the bottleneck is *selling it, positioning it, and proving its value*. The curriculum must teach engineers how to translate technical architecture into business value.

The curriculum must integrate technical environments (Git, VSCode, Python, AI tools) with liberal arts concepts (Stoicism, Art History, Rhetoric) and business fundamentals (Sales, Positioning, Value Translation) through an **Action-First Integration** model. We do not teach tools in isolation; we teach philosophy, product thinking, and business *by having them build, govern, and pitch systems*.

Crucially, the curriculum will explicitly teach the mechanics of human influence. We will use **Robert Cialdini's principles of persuasion** and **Mark & Pearson's brand archetypes (The Hero and the Outlaw)** not as marketing tricks, but as fundamental engineering tools for understanding human behavior, designing user experiences, and selling technical vision.

The curriculum is built on the premise of the **"Double Stripping"**: AI is automating procedural cognitive skills from above, while K-12 education is failing to provide foundational literacy and numeracy from below. The only durable educational response is to develop capabilities that cannot be automated—inquiry, judgment, resilience, humility, systems thinking, accountable leadership, and translation—through a pedagogy that starts from the actual preparation level of the students.

The ultimate goal is to train engineers who have **stakes**. As the BSEAI "Letter from the AI" states: "A human being is for having stakes." The AI can generate code, but it cannot care about the outcome, exercise moral judgment, or take responsibility for failure. The curriculum must develop these uniquely human capacities.

## Objectives

1.  **Define the 12-Week Structure (The Campaign):** Map out the weekly progression across the three core phases of the Product Engineer: The Foundation (Order & Logic), The Director (Taste & Architecture), and The Maestro (Rhetoric, Responsibility, & Sales).
2.  **Action-First Integration:** Ensure every technical action is driven by a philosophical or product requirement. (e.g., You don't learn Git to "save code"; you learn Git to enforce Stoic state management and revert chaos).
3.  **Design the Learning Modalities:** Balance active learning (building and governing), reflection (defending architectural decisions), and passive consumption (the Canon reading list). **Crucially, Studio Ordo acts as the "Cliff Notes" and the curator (The 10% Rule).** We do not assign 400-page books; we extract the top 10% of insights from the top 10 thinkers that yield 80% of the results (e.g., Krug's cognitive load, Tufte's data-ink ratio, Aurelius's dichotomy of control). We provide curated playlists of high-signal podcasts, essays, and videos for them to consume while commuting or exercising.
4.  **Establish the "Operating Baseline":** Incorporate habits, mindset, and biological discipline (inspired by Huberman, Peterson, Aurelius) as *prerequisites* for engineering, not self-help. You cannot govern an AI if you cannot govern your own attention.
5.  **Master the Mechanics of Influence:** Teach engineers how to use Cialdini's principles (Reciprocity, Authority, Social Proof, etc.) and Brand Archetypes to design software that people actually want to use, and to pitch architectures that stakeholders actually want to buy.
6.  **Ground in High-Level LLM Theory (The Alien Mind):** Engineers must understand *what* the machine is doing. We teach the high-level theory of Large Language Models (probabilistic generation, attention mechanisms, latent space, context windows) to build *intuition* for why models hallucinate, how they rationalize rather than reason, and why they lack inductive logic. They must understand that the LLM does not "care" about truth; it cares about statistical likelihood.
7.  **Build the Verification Toolchain:** Because the LLM is an alien mind that rationalizes without reasoning, humans cannot manually verify its output at scale. We must teach engineers to build and imagine the *toolchains* required to govern AI. This means integrating deterministic tools (linters, static analysis, unit tests, formal verification) as the non-negotiable boundary around the probabilistic AI.
8.  **The Automated Audit & Escalation Loop:** Reflection and critique are built into the workflow. Submissions receive immediate, automated AI feedback (The Audit). Students must write a formal defense (e.g., an Architecture Decision Record) accepting or rejecting the AI's critique. Optional AI chat is available for deeper exploration, but the ultimate escalation path is always to a human Maestro when judgment is contested.
9.  **Create the Capstone Project Spec (The Manifesto):** Define the final project where students don't just submit code, but submit a working product alongside a written defense of *why* it exists, *how* they governed the AI that built it, and a *pitch* for its business value.
10. **Develop the "Human Edge" Capabilities:** Explicitly map curriculum activities to the eight core capabilities that AI cannot replicate: Disciplined Inquiry, Professional Judgment, Resilience Thinking, Problem Finding, Epistemic Humility, Systems Thinking, Accountable Leadership, and Translation.
11. **Implement the 40/60 Split:** Ensure the curriculum balances 40% manual work (to build the substrate of understanding and judgment) with 60% agentic work (to build the workflow of the future). Students must understand the domain deeply enough to evaluate AI output before they can effectively govern it.

## Deliverables

1.  `01-curriculum-spec.md`: The high-level architecture, learning objectives, and pedagogical philosophy.
2.  `02-the-campaign.md`: Detailed week-by-week breakdown of missions, readings, and product governance tasks.
3.  `03-project-specs.md`: Specifications for the weekly gate projects and the final Capstone Manifesto.
4.  `04-the-canon.md`: The curated list of required readings, videos, and cultural artifacts (museums, art, etc.).
5.  `05-platform-requirements.md`: A list of features or changes needed in the LMS platform to support this new curriculum structure (e.g., reflection journals, manifesto submissions).
