# UX Review — Home

- Route: `/`
- Audience: Unauthenticated first-time and returning visitors
- Overall score: 7.4/10

## What works
- Single primary call to action (`Browse Events`) keeps intent obvious.
- Visual hierarchy is clean and low cognitive load.
- Above-the-fold content communicates the product domain quickly.

## Friction points
- Secondary message says admin pages are “upcoming sprints,” which is outdated and can reduce trust.
- Home lacks a short “what you can do in 30 seconds” value proposition.
- No visible path to login/register from the hero block.

## Recommendations
### Now
- Replace outdated sprint copy with user-oriented messaging (“Sign in to manage registrations” / “Admin tools available for authorized users”).
- Add secondary CTAs: `Login` and `Create account` near primary CTA.
- Add one compact benefit strip (e.g., discover events, register, manage attendance).

### Next
- Add small social-proof/credibility cue (event count, active organizations, or recent updates).
- Add footer-level support links to reduce dead-end perception.

## Success criteria
- Increased click-through to `/events` and `/login` from home.
- Lower bounce for first-time sessions.
- Fewer “where do I start?” support questions.
