# UX Review — Terms

- Route: `/terms`
- Audience: All users
- Overall score: 6.8/10

## What works
- Terms route is present and linked from key auth pages.
- Copy is straightforward at a sentence level.

## Friction points
- Content lacks the structure needed for practical comprehension.
- No anchors or headings for scan-heavy legal reading.
- No account lifecycle clauses surfaced (suspension, deletion, dispute process).
- No revision date or version traceability.

## Recommendations
### Now
- Add sectioned structure: acceptable use, account security, prohibited conduct, termination, liability, updates.
- Add “Last updated” and version marker.
- Add cross-links to privacy and account deletion flows.

### Next
- Add short plain-language summary at top.
- Add contact/escalation details for policy questions.

## Success criteria
- Better legal clarity for end users.
- Fewer policy interpretation tickets.
- Stronger auditability of policy revisions.
