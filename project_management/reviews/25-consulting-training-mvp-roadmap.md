# MVP Roadmap — Consulting + Training Fundamentals

## Objective
Define the minimum complete product foundation to operate a consulting/training business for individuals and groups across online and in-person modes, including instructor `TBA` workflows.

## Phase 1 (Foundational, 4–6 weeks)
- Service catalog + packages
- Booking/intake pipeline
- Engagement + session core entities
- Instructor assignment with `TBA` state
- Basic communications (booking confirmations + reminders)

### Exit criteria
- New inquiry can become a scheduled session with clear delivery mode and instructor state.

## Phase 2 (Operational, 4–6 weeks)
- Group roster management
- Individual vs group differentiated journeys
- Mode-specific logistics (venue/link instructions)
- Admin safety rails for destructive/privileged actions
- Early outcomes logging

### Exit criteria
- Team can deliver repeatable group and individual engagements without spreadsheet dependence.

## Phase 3 (Commercial + Client Value, 4–8 weeks)
- Proposal and invoice workflows
- Payment state tracking
- Client portal for outcomes + artifacts
- Feedback loops and quality metrics

### Exit criteria
- Team can run end-to-end commercial operations and prove delivered value.

## Non-negotiable UX guardrails
- Destructive actions always require explicit confirmation.
- High-risk admin operations show impact preview before commit.
- Every async workflow yields durable, understandable status feedback.
- Every booking path communicates next step and ownership.

## Suggested KPI baseline
- Inquiry → booked conversion rate
- Booking lead time
- Session no-show rate
- Instructor utilization
- Client satisfaction / NPS
- Repeat booking rate

## Recommended immediate implementation order
1. P0 safety fixes from `16-cross-cutting-critical-findings.md`
2. Service catalog + intake (`18`, `19`)
3. Instructor/TBA + delivery modes (`20`, `22`)
4. Group/individual differentiation (`21`)
5. Commercial + portal value layer (`23`, `24`)
