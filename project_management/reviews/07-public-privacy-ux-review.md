# UX Review — Privacy

- Route: `/privacy`
- Audience: All users (legal reassurance)
- Overall score: 6.7/10

## What works
- Page exists and is reachable from auth flows.
- Content is concise and readable.

## Friction points
- Current copy is too brief for user trust and compliance clarity.
- No structure (headings, sections, retention timeline, contact).
- No “last updated” signal.
- No cross-linking to terms or account deletion behavior.

## Recommendations
### Now
- Expand into structured sections: data collected, purpose, retention, deletion, user rights, contact.
- Add “Last updated” timestamp.
- Add plain-language summary at top (“in short”).

### Next
- Add jurisdiction and lawful basis references if applicable.
- Add FAQ micro-section for common privacy concerns.

## Success criteria
- Increased time-on-page with reduced bounce.
- Fewer trust-related support tickets.
- Better legal discoverability from auth/account screens.
