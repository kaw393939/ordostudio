# Gap Audit — Minimal UI Plan vs Current Site

Date: 2026-02-23

This audit maps the current route inventory to the target operating model:
- Keep (human cockpit)
- Keep but reduce (progressive disclosure)
- Replace with CLI/MCP (agent-first)
- Remove or restrict (rare/advanced)

Sources:
- `docs/page-surface-inventory-2026-02-23.md`
- `docs/ux-plan-minimal-ui-agent-ops-2026-02-23.md`

Legend:
- **KEEP**: essential human UI
- **REDUCE**: keep UI but simplify and hide rare actions
- **REPLACE**: agent/CLI/MCP should own; UI becomes read-only or removed
- **RESTRICT**: keep only behind role gates or break-glass

---

## Public routes

KEEP
- `/`, `/services`, `/services/request`, `/events`, `/events/[slug]`, `/studio`, `/apprentices`, `/newsletter`

REDUCE
- `/resources/*`, `/frameworks/*` (keep, but ensure nav doesn’t bloat the header)

KEEP (supporting)
- `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/login`, `/register`

---

## Account routes

KEEP
- `/account` (role cockpit)
- `/account/apprentice-profile` (apprentice self-serve)

REDUCE
- Any settings/payments screens should default to disclosure inside `/account` unless frequency justifies separate routes.

---

## Operator routes (/admin)

KEEP (human cockpits)
- `/admin/deals` (maestro daily driver)
- `/admin/intake` (triage)
- `/admin/events` (program ops)
- `/admin/ledger` (money approvals)
- `/admin/newsletter` (review + publish)
- `/admin/audit` (incident timelines; often read-only)
- `/admin/users` (support lookup; consider reducing)

REDUCE (keep but simplify)
- `/admin/referrals` (mostly reporting; keep if used weekly)
- `/admin/field-reports` (apprentice accountability; keep if central)
- `/admin/registrations` (should be event-centric; avoid duplicate list views)
- `/admin/engagements` (only if actively managed)

REPLACE (agent/CLI/MCP-first)
- `/admin/measurement`, `/admin/flywheel` (should be reports generated by agents; UI can be read-only dashboards)
- `/admin/entitlements` (agent-managed sync + break-glass UI)
- `/admin/settings` (agent/CLI; UI only for read-only environment status)
- `/admin/commercial` (if this is a pipeline that can be represented in Deals + Offers, remove separate UI)
- `/admin/apprentices` (prefer directory + apprentice profiles; keep only if heavy operator need)

RESTRICT
- Any super-admin power tools: user role escalation, destructive operations.

---

## Menu + IA implications

Current (post-fixes)
- Desktop: left sidebar is canonical admin nav.
- Mobile: admin quick strip shows top tasks.

Target
- Admin nav should emphasize:
  - Deals, Intake, Events, Ledger
  - Newsletter (if weekly)
- Remove “rare/advanced” from the default nav:
  - settings/entitlements/measurement/flywheel
  - expose via Cmd+K or agent/CLI

---

## Biggest wins (highest ROI reductions)

1) Move “settings/entitlements/measurement/flywheel” to agent-first.
2) Consolidate registrations + engagements into event-centric ops (avoid duplicated list surfaces).
3) Keep Maestro UI calm: one queue, one focus pane, clear next actions.

---

## Open decisions (needed to finalize sprint scope)

Decisions (strategic defaults):

1) Newsletter: treat as a **weekly ritual**, but do **not** elevate it to the top-level “daily driver” navigation.
  - Keep the Newsletter cockpit.
  - Surface it inside the Maestro cockpit (“Ship newsletter”) and via operator navigation.
  - Keep the default nav focused on daily throughput work.

2) Maestro permissions: Maestro is an **operator/editor**, not a super-admin.
  - Maestro owns: Deals + Events + Newsletter review/publish.
  - Maestro does not own: ledger payouts/refunds, role/entitlement escalation, destructive admin tools.
  - Maestro can have read-only visibility into money/identity when needed for context.

3) Operator routes to keep in UI: keep only the screens that support high-context work and approvals.
  - Keep (UI): Deals, Intake, Events, Newsletter, Audit (read-first), Users (support lookup).
  - Move to agent-first (CLI/MCP) or SUPER_ADMIN-only UI: settings, entitlements, measurement, flywheel, bulk ops.
