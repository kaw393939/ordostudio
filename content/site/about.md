# About Studio Ordo

Studio Ordo is a training and commissions studio focused on AI-directed software delivery. We exist to help professionals and teams get ahead of the shift that is already happening.

## What We Do

We do two things:

**We train professionals to direct AI.** The Maestro Training program teaches senior engineers, architects, and technical leads how to specify, evaluate, and take responsibility for AI-generated work. This is not a coding bootcamp. It is a leadership capability for people who already know how to build.

**We commission project work through the guild.** When clients need software built, we assemble a team from our network of trained Journeymen and Maestros. Studio Ordo manages the engagement and takes 20% of the project fee. The guild members do the work and keep the rest.

## Our Background

Studio Ordo has been teaching engineers for 23 years. More than 10,000 professionals have trained through programs we have run. We have seen every wave of tooling change in software development. The AI shift is the biggest.

## Our Position

AI is automating the execution layer of software delivery — the syntax, the boilerplate, the scaffolding. What remains is direction: the capability to specify what should be built, evaluate whether the output is any good, and take responsibility for the result.

We are not neutral about this. We think the professionals who learn to direct AI will be the ones who matter. We built Studio Ordo to train that capability before the window closes.

## Location and Contact

Studio Ordo operates remotely. Our primary contact is hello@studioordo.com. Consultations can be booked at our booking page. We do not have a walk-in location.
