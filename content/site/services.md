# Studio Ordo Services

Studio Ordo offers two categories of service: training and project commissions.

## Maestro Training

The Maestro Training program teaches senior professionals how to direct AI effectively in software delivery contexts.

**Format:** Small cohorts of 6–12 participants, plus optional 1:1 advisory.

**Who it is for:** Senior engineers, architects, engineering managers, and technical leads who already understand software delivery and need to adapt their practice to AI-directed work.

**What you learn:**
- How to write AI work specifications that produce usable output
- How to evaluate AI-generated code and design for correctness, maintainability, and risk
- How to run an AI-directed delivery cycle: brief, iterate, review, ship
- How to build the judgment layer that AI cannot provide

**Pricing:**
- Cohort enrollment: $3,000–$5,000 depending on cohort size and duration
- Ongoing 1:1 advisory: $1,500–$2,500/month

**How to enroll:** Complete an intake form or talk to the intake agent. Acceptance is based on fit — we keep cohorts small so they stay useful.

## Project Commissions

If you need software work done, we can assemble a team from our guild and manage the engagement.

**How it works:**
1. You commission the project through Studio Ordo via an intake form
2. A Maestro reviews your brief and proposes a scope
3. We assign Journeymen and Maestros from the guild to execute
4. Studio Ordo takes 20% of the project fee; the guild members keep the rest
5. You work directly with the assigned team

**What you get:** A team that has been trained in AI-directed delivery, managed by a Maestro who is accountable for the output.

**What we do not do:** Body-shop staffing. We manage the work, not just the placement.

**Pricing:** Project-dependent. Contact us to discuss scope.
