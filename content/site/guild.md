# The Studio Ordo Guild

The guild is the talent network that executes commissioned project work. Members are professionals who have trained with Studio Ordo or have been accepted based on demonstrated capability.

## Guild Hierarchy

There are four levels in the guild. Progression is based on demonstrated work and contribution, not time served.

### Affiliate

The entry point. Affiliates are professionals who have a relationship with Studio Ordo — they refer clients, refer candidates, and participate in the network. Affiliates earn commissions on successful referrals.

Affiliates do not execute project work directly through the guild. They are the network layer that keeps the guild growing.

**How to become an Affiliate:** Complete the application on the site. Acceptance is based on your professional background and referral potential.

### Apprentice

Apprentices are active learners in the Studio Ordo system. They are enrolled in or have completed a training track. They may assist on guild projects under direct Journeyman or Maestro supervision.

Apprentices earn a percentage of any supervised project work they contribute to.

**How to become an Apprentice:** Complete Maestro Training or be accepted into an apprenticeship track.

### Journeyman

Journeymen execute project work independently. They direct AI on scoped deliverables, are accountable for quality, and report to the assigned Maestro for each engagement.

Journeymen keep 80% of their portion of the project fee. Studio Ordo takes 20%.

**How to become a Journeyman:** Demonstrate consistent delivery quality as an Apprentice. Promoted by Maestro recommendation.

### Maestro

Maestros own engagements. They scope the work, brief the team, review output, and are the client's single point of accountability. Maestros also run training cohorts.

Maestros receive a higher share of project fees and advisory fees. Promoted from Journeyman by Studio Ordo based on track record.

## Commission Structure

Studio Ordo takes 20% of all project fees. Guild members keep the remaining 80%, split according to their role and contribution on each engagement. Affiliate referral commissions are paid separately.
