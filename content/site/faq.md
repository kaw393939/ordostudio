# Frequently Asked Questions

## About Studio Ordo

**What does Studio Ordo do?**
Studio Ordo trains professionals to direct AI in software delivery, and commissions project work through a network of trained practitioners called the guild. We do training and project execution — those are our two revenue lines.

**Who is Studio Ordo for?**
Three types of people come to us: buyers who need project work commissioned, learners who want to direct AI effectively, and builders who want to join the guild as an Affiliate, Apprentice, or Journeyman.

**How long has Studio Ordo been operating?**
We have been teaching engineers for 23 years. More than 10,000 professionals have trained through our programs.

## Maestro Training

**What is Maestro Training?**
A structured program that teaches professionals how to specify, brief, evaluate, and take responsibility for AI-generated software work. It runs in small cohorts of 6–12 people.

**How much does it cost?**
Cohort enrollment is $3,000–$5,000. Ongoing 1:1 advisory is $1,500–$2,500/month.

**Do I need to know how to code?**
You should have a working understanding of software delivery — either as an engineer, architect, or technical manager. This is not a "no-code" program. It is for people who understand the domain and need to adapt their practice.

**How do I enroll?**
Talk to our intake agent or fill out the form at studioordo.com/apply. We review every application.

## Project Commissions

**How does commissioning a project work?**
You submit an intake request with your project brief. A Maestro reviews it and proposes a scope. We assemble a team from the guild and manage the engagement. You work directly with the team.

**What is Studio Ordo's fee?**
We take 20% of the project fee. Guild members keep the remaining 80%.

**What kinds of projects do you take?**
Software delivery projects where AI-directed execution is appropriate — features, systems, integrations, and builds. We do not do infrastructure operations, security audits, or non-software work.

## The Guild

**How do I join the guild?**
Start at studioordo.com/apply. We accept Affiliates, Apprentices, and Journeymen. All applicants go through an intake review.

**What is the difference between Apprentice and Journeyman?**
Apprentices are learners who assist on supervised work. Journeymen execute independently and are accountable for deliverables. Journeymen are promoted from Apprentice based on demonstrated delivery quality.

**Can I refer someone and earn a commission?**
Yes. Affiliates earn commissions on referrals that convert to clients or guild members. See the commission policy for details.
