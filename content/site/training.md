# Maestro Training Program

## What the Program Is

The Maestro Training program teaches professionals how to direct AI in software delivery. It is not about writing code with AI assistance. It is about owning the work — specifying what gets built, evaluating whether the output is any good, and taking accountability for the result.

The professional who can do that reliably is worth more as AI capability increases. The one who cannot is being replaced.

## Who It Is For

- Senior engineers who want to stay relevant as AI absorbs execution work
- Engineering managers who need to evaluate AI-directed delivery without writing the code themselves
- Technical architects who are scoping AI-assisted projects and need a reliable framework
- Founders and technical leads who are making AI decisions without a structured approach

**It is not for:** complete beginners to software. You should arrive knowing how software gets built. We teach you how to direct it under AI conditions.

## Format

**Cohorts:** Groups of 6–12. Each cohort runs over 8 weeks with weekly sessions plus async work. Cohorts are kept small deliberately — the value is in peer calibration, not lecture.

**1:1 Advisory:** Available alongside or after cohort completion. Monthly engagements. Focused on your specific delivery context, team, and decisions.

**Online:** All training is conducted remotely. Sessions are live, not pre-recorded.

## What You Learn

**Week 1–2: The Shift**
What has changed in software delivery and what has not. The execution layer is being automated; the direction layer is not. How to assess your own position.

**Week 3–4: Specification**
How to write AI work briefs that produce usable output. The anatomy of a well-specified deliverable. Common failure modes and how to avoid them.

**Week 5–6: Evaluation**
How to review AI-generated code and design. What correctness means when you did not write the code. Quality signals that do not require reading every line.

**Week 7–8: Practice**
Running a full AI-directed delivery cycle from brief to ship. Handling failure, iteration, and handoff. Building the habit.

## Outcomes

Graduates of the program are able to:
- Write AI specifications that produce first-pass useful output more than 80% of the time
- Review AI-generated deliverables with structured rigor, not intuition
- Run a brief-to-ship AI delivery cycle on a real project
- Train others on their team to use the same framework

## Pricing

- **Cohort:** $3,000–$5,000 per participant (depends on cohort size and duration)
- **1:1 Advisory:** $1,500–$2,500/month

Payment is due before the first session. We do not offer payment plans at this time.
