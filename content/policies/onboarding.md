# Onboarding Policy

## What Happens After You Are Accepted

When Studio Ordo accepts your application, you will receive a welcome email with your login credentials and a link to your onboarding checklist. Completing the checklist activates your account.

## The Onboarding Checklist

All new members complete a role-specific onboarding checklist. Tasks vary by role but generally include:

- **Profile completion:** Add your name, bio, and professional background. This is visible to staff and, for Journeymen and Maestros, to clients.
- **Payout account setup (Affiliates and above):** Connect a Stripe account to receive commissions. This is required before any payout can be processed. It takes about 10 minutes.
- **QR card order (Affiliates):** Studio Ordo provides a digital QR business card that links to your unique referral URL. You will receive instructions to generate and download it.
- **Intro call (Apprentices):** A 30-minute call with a Maestro to discuss your training goals and assign your track.

You can access your checklist from your dashboard at any time.

## Timeline

- Welcome email is sent within 1 business day of acceptance
- Account access is granted when the welcome email is sent
- Most members complete their onboarding checklist within 3–5 business days
- Accounts are considered fully active when all required checklist items are complete

## Questions During Onboarding

If you have questions during onboarding, contact hello@studioordo.com or use the chat on the site. Reference "onboarding" in your message so it routes to the right person.
