# Commission Policy

## Studio Ordo Commission Rate

Studio Ordo takes 20% of all project fees on guild-executed work. This is not negotiable and applies to every engagement.

Guild members — Journeymen and Maestros — keep the remaining 80%, distributed according to their role and contribution on each project. The distribution is agreed before the engagement begins.

## Affiliate Referral Commissions

Affiliates who refer clients or candidates to Studio Ordo earn commissions on successful conversions.

**What counts as a conversion:**
- A referred prospect who completes an intake request and is accepted as a client
- A referred professional who is accepted into the guild as an Apprentice or higher

**Rate:** Affiliate referral commissions are set at the time of enrollment. The current rate is posted in your dashboard.

**How payouts work:**
1. A conversion is recorded when the referred party completes intake and is approved
2. The commission is calculated and posted to your ledger
3. Payouts are processed when your ledger balance reaches the minimum payout threshold ($50)
4. Payouts are made via Stripe Connect. You must complete payout account setup before any commission can be disbursed

**Minimum payout:** $50. Balances below this threshold roll over to the next payout cycle.

## Commission Disputes

If you believe a commission has been miscalculated or a conversion was not attributed correctly, contact hello@studioordo.com with the referral code, the referred party's email, and the date of the conversion. We review all disputes within 5 business days.

## Commission Schedule

Commissions are calculated monthly. Payouts are processed in the first week of the following month.

## Tax Compliance

Affiliates who earn commissions through Studio Ordo are responsible for their own tax reporting. Studio Ordo will issue a 1099 (or equivalent for non-US affiliates) to any affiliate who earns $600 or more in a calendar year.

Payout account setup requires submission of basic tax information (legal name, entity type, and address). This information is used solely for compliance purposes.
