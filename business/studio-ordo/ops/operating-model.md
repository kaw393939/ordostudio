# Studio Ordo — Operating Model

## Executive summary
Studio Ordo is a **managed marketplace** for AI consulting delivered by independent contractors ("apprentices" and "maestros"), operated by Keith Williams' LLC.

The platform provides:
- standardized, upfront-priced offers (“union pricing”)
- lead capture + matching + supervision
- auditable workflow + payments/refunds control
- an editorial/media engine (field reports → newsletter)

## Business loops
### Loop A — Marketplace delivery
1) Acquire lead (cards/QR, web, referrals) → intake
2) Maestro triage + risk flags
3) Assign provider (apprentice) + approve deal
4) Upfront payment
5) Delivery + follow-ups
6) Completion, refund decision (if needed)
7) Ledgered commission + provider payout approvals

### Loop B — Editorial flywheel
1) Apprentices attend events → submit field reports
2) Maestro/admin review + feature
3) Draft newsletter generated from reports + curated sources
4) Editorial review + publish + email send
5) More trust → more leads → more field work

## Guardrails (non-negotiables)
- Clients **do not pick providers**; they may request a provider.
- Maestro has **final assignment authority** to protect quality and apprentices.
- No work starts until:
  - deal is **maestro-approved**, and
  - payment is **captured** (upfront).
- Refunds are **platform-controlled**.
- Commissions/payouts are **ledgered** and **approval-based**.

## Commercial model
- Platform sets standardized prices per offer.
- A deal may record:
  - referrer (affiliate) for commission
  - provider (delivering apprentice)
  - supervising maestro

## Audit and accountability
- Every mutation must write an audit entry (who/what/when/request-id).
- Money movement must be explainable via ledger rows (earned → approved → paid).

## Operating cadence
- Weekly:
  - intake triage + assignment review
  - delivery status review
  - payout approval batch (as volume increases)
  - editorial planning for newsletter
- Monthly:
  - pricing review (minor)
  - quality review (outcomes + refunds + client satisfaction)
  - apprenticeship health review (load, escalation, burnout risk)
