# Studio Ordo — Workshop Catalog

## Overview

Eight workshops, each built around one Human Edge capability and structured with the 40/60 Method. Participants leave with a tangible artifact — not just knowledge, but evidence of what they can do.

- The AI Audit Log discipline — documenting every AI decision
- When to accept, reject, or modify AI output
- Technical debt awareness in AI-generated code
- The Pragmatic Programmer principles applied to AI workflows

**Exercise:** Pair exercise — complete a coding task with AI assistance, document every decision in the AI Audit Log format. Compare results across pairs.

**Spell Book terms introduced:** Technical debt, broken windows, DRY, YAGNI, KISS, MVP, CI/CD, edge cases

**Artifact produced:** Completed AI Audit Log with 5+ entries + team adoption plan for introducing the practice.

## Workshop 3: Design for Failure

**Duration:** Full-day (6 hours)
**Audience:** Engineering teams, SREs, DevOps engineers
**Human Edge:** Resilience Thinking
**Price tier:** Offer 2 (developer accelerator)

**What participants learn:**
- The Twelve-Factor App methodology
- Failure Mode Analysis — identifying what can break before it breaks
- Error budgets and how to manage them
- Blameless postmortem process
- Incident drill methodology

**Exercise:** Live incident drill — the maestro introduces a controlled failure into a system. The team must detect, diagnose, and recover within a time limit. Followed by a blameless postmortem.

**Spell Book terms introduced:** Twelve-Factor App, SOLID, infrastructure as code, error budget, blameless postmortem, circuit breaker, MTTR, runbook

**Artifact produced:** Failure Mode Analysis document for the team's actual system + incident response playbook.

## Workshop 4: Find the Right Problem

**Duration:** Half-day (3 hours)
**Audience:** Product managers, engineering managers, consultants
**Human Edge:** Problem Finding
**Price tier:** Offer 1 (consultation/workshop)

**What participants learn:**
- Jobs to Be Done framework (Christensen)
- Five Whys root cause analysis
- The Assumptions Log — tracking what you believe vs. what you know
- Fermi estimation for quick ROI analysis
- Brooks's Law and the Second-System Effect

**Exercise:** Apply JTBD + Five Whys to a real business problem the participant brings. Estimate ROI with Fermi estimation. Document assumptions.

**Spell Book terms introduced:** Jobs to Be Done, Five Whys, essential vs. accidental complexity, business model canvas, Fermi estimation, ROI, Brooks's Law

**Artifact produced:** Problem analysis package — assumptions log, JTBD analysis, and Fermi-estimated ROI for one real problem.

## Workshop 5: Data Architecture for AI

**Duration:** Full-day (6 hours)
**Audience:** Data engineers, backend engineers, AI engineers
**Human Edge:** Epistemic Humility
**Price tier:** Offer 2 (developer accelerator)

**What participants learn:**
- SQL fluency — why manual query writing builds judgment
- Graph databases and knowledge graph design
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Hybrid retrieval architectures (SQL + graph + vector)
- CAP theorem and honest tradeoffs
- Data Assumptions Documents — what the data captures and what it misses

**Exercise:** Build a hybrid knowledge system prototype — relational data + graph relationships + vector search. Document what the data does not capture.

**Spell Book terms introduced:** Relational model, ACID, normalization, SQL injection, CAP theorem, knowledge graph, vector embedding, cosine similarity, hybrid retrieval

**Artifact produced:** Data Assumptions Document + working hybrid retrieval prototype.

## Workshop 6: Systems-Level AI Architecture

**Duration:** Full-day (6 hours)
**Audience:** Senior engineers, architects, engineering managers
**Human Edge:** Systems Thinking
**Price tier:** Offer 2 (developer accelerator)

**What participants learn:**
- Conway's Law — why organizational structure shapes system architecture
- Meadows's leverage points — where to intervene in complex systems
- STRIDE threat modeling for AI systems
- System decomposition methodology
- Non-functional requirements and emergent behavior
- Zero Trust architecture for AI components

**Exercise:** Decompose a real system into components, identify leverage points, run a STRIDE threat model. Produce an architecture fitness assessment.

**Spell Book terms introduced:** Conway's Law, leverage points, Liskov Substitution, code smells, refactoring, STRIDE, Zero Trust, iron triangle, emergent behavior

**Artifact produced:** Systems decomposition document + STRIDE threat model + architecture fitness assessment.
