# Workshop 4: Find the Right Problem

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Duration** | Half-day (3 hours) |
| **Audience** | Product managers, engineering managers, consultants |
| **Human Edge** | Problem Finding |
| **Prerequisites** | None — bring a real business problem |
| **Max participants** | 20 |
| **Offer tier** | Offer 1 (consultation/workshop) |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1. Apply the Jobs to Be Done framework to distinguish stated problems from real problems
2. Use Five Whys to trace business symptoms to root causes
3. Maintain an Assumptions Log that separates what they know from what they believe
4. Produce a Fermi estimation for quick ROI analysis
5. Build a full four-component Context Pack for a business problem

## Agenda

| Time | Block | Format | Description |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:20 | The Expensive Wrong Problem | Presentation | Case studies of organizations that built the wrong thing. Fred Brooks: essential vs. accidental complexity. The cost of solving the stated problem instead of the real one. |
| 0:20–0:50 | Jobs to Be Done (40%) | Hands-on | Apply JTBD to a provided scenario: what is the customer actually trying to accomplish? Manual analysis — no AI. |
| 0:50–1:15 | Five Whys + Assumptions Log | Exercise | Trace a business symptom to root cause. Document every assumption in the Assumptions Log format. |
| 1:15–1:30 | Break | — | — |
| 1:30–1:55 | Fermi Estimation | Exercise | Quick ROI analysis for the problem: is this worth solving? Approximate with limited data. |
| 1:55–2:35 | Full Context Pack (60%) | AI-directed | Participants build a complete four-component Context Pack for their real problem. AI assists with research, domain context, and evaluation criteria generation. |
| 2:35–2:55 | Problem Framing Presentations | Group | Each participant presents their problem framing: stated problem vs. real problem, assumptions vs. evidence, estimated ROI. |
| 2:55–3:00 | Wrap-up | Presentation | Spell Book review. The Assumptions Log as an ongoing practice. |

## FAQ

**"I'm an engineer, not a product person."**
Every engineer who has built the wrong thing understands why problem finding matters. This workshop prevents expensive misdirection.

**"What if I don't have a business problem?"**
We provide three scenarios. But the workshop is most valuable when applied to a real problem you are currently facing.
