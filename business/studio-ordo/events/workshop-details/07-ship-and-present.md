# Workshop 7: Ship & Present

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Duration** | Half-day (3 hours) |
| **Audience** | Teams preparing for stakeholder reviews, demo days, project handoffs |
| **Human Edge** | Accountable Leadership |
| **Prerequisites** | A project or system to present (any stage — prototype to production) |
| **Max participants** | 20 (organized into teams of 2–4) |
| **Offer tier** | Offer 1 (consultation/workshop) |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1. Structure a 10-minute evidence-based demo (not a slideshow — a live system demonstration)
2. Present evaluation data, metrics, and limitations alongside features
3. Handle stakeholder Q&A with honesty about tradeoffs and unknowns
4. Write a blameless postmortem that names systemic causes
5. Create an improvement plan based on rubric feedback

## Agenda

| Time | Block | Format | Description |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:20 | Evidence Over Slides | Presentation | Why most demos fail: they show what works and hide what does not. The Demo Day rubric. What "accountable leadership" looks like. |
| 0:20–0:40 | The Rubric | Review | Walk through the evaluation rubric: Technical quality, evidence strength, limitation honesty, presentation clarity, Q&A readiness. |
| 0:40–1:15 | Demo Preparation (40%) | Team exercise | Teams structure their demo using the rubric as a guide. Identify: what evidence do we have? What are we proud of? What are we honest about? |
| 1:15–1:30 | Break | — | — |
| 1:30–2:20 | Demo Presentations (60%) | Live demos | Each team delivers a 10-minute structured demo. Rubric-based scoring by the maestro and peers. Timed. Real Q&A. |
| 2:20–2:40 | Feedback Review | Individual | Teams receive their rubric scores and written feedback. Identify top 2 strengths and top 2 improvements. |
| 2:40–2:55 | Improvement Plan + Postmortem | Exercise | Write a blameless postmortem for "what we would do differently." Draft an improvement plan for the next demo. |
| 2:55–3:00 | Wrap-up | Presentation | Spell Book review. The Andon cord principle. Why "I don't know" is a leadership statement. |

## Demo Day Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Technical Quality** | 25% | Live system with automated tests, monitoring, and evaluation data | Working system with tests | Working prototype, limited testing | Slides or mockup |
| **Evidence Strength** | 25% | Metrics, benchmarks, and evaluation harness results | Some metrics and test results | Anecdotal evidence | No evidence |
| **Limitation Honesty** | 20% | Proactively names what does not work and why | Acknowledges limitations when asked | Minimizes limitations | Claims everything works |
| **Presentation Clarity** | 15% | Clear, structured, within time limit, audience-appropriate | Mostly clear, minor time issues | Disorganized or over time | Incoherent or missing |
| **Q&A Readiness** | 15% | Handles tough questions with data and honest uncertainty | Answers most questions competently | Struggles with unexpected questions | Cannot answer questions |

## Materials

- Demo Day rubric (printable scorecard)
- Demo structure template (10-minute format)
- Blameless postmortem template
- Improvement plan template
- Spell Book handout: Stochastic Parrots, HITL, evaluation harness, prompt injection, regression gate, blameless postmortem, error budget, Andon cord

## Artifact Produced

- Rubric-scored demo presentation (with scores for all 5 criteria)
- Written peer feedback
- Blameless postmortem
- Improvement plan for the next stakeholder review

## FAQ

**"We don't have a finished product."**
Perfect. The rubric values honest limitation disclosure. A prototype presented with evidence and acknowledged gaps scores higher than a polished demo that hides problems.

**"Can this be used for internal stakeholder reviews?"**
Absolutely. The rubric and format work for board presentations, sprint reviews, client demos, and investor pitches. The structure is the same — evidence over slides.
