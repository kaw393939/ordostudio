# Workshop 1: Ask Better Questions

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Duration** | Half-day (3 hours) |
| **Audience** | Engineers, team leads, product managers |
| **Human Edge** | Disciplined Inquiry |
| **Prerequisites** | None — this is the foundational workshop |
| **Max participants** | 20 |
| **Offer tier** | Offer 1 (consultation/workshop) |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1. Decompose an ambiguous problem into a structured question hierarchy using issue trees
2. Apply the Five Whys technique to distinguish symptoms from root causes
3. Formulate hypothesis-first investigations before writing code or generating prompts
4. Write a Project Brief (Context Pack component 1) for a real problem

## Agenda

| Time | Block | Format | Description |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:20 | Welcome + Framing | Presentation | Why the right question matters more than the right answer. The Human Edge: Disciplined Inquiry. |
| 0:20–0:50 | Issue Trees | Hands-on (40%) | Participants build issue trees for a provided ambiguous scenario. Manual decomposition — no AI. |
| 0:50–1:10 | Five Whys | Hands-on (40%) | Apply five iterations of "why?" to trace a symptom to a root cause. |
| 1:10–1:25 | Break | — | — |
| 1:25–1:50 | Hypothesis-First Thinking | Discussion + exercise | Reframe problems as testable hypotheses. What do I believe? How would I test it? |
| 1:50–2:30 | Real Problem Application (60%) | AI-directed exercise | Participants apply structured inquiry to a problem they brought. Use AI to research, validate, and refine their question hierarchy. Document in Context Pack Project Brief format. |
| 2:30–2:50 | Share + Critique | Group | Each participant presents their question hierarchy. Peer feedback using CRC (Commend, Recommend, Commend). |
| 2:50–3:00 | Wrap-up | Presentation | Spell Book review. How to use this tomorrow. |

## Materials

- Issue tree template (printable + digital)
- Five Whys worksheet
- Context Pack Project Brief template
- Spell Book handout: First principles, separation of concerns, CRC critique, progressive enhancement, version control

## Artifact Produced

A written inquiry framework for one real problem — including:
- Issue tree decomposition
- Five Whys root cause trace
- Hypothesis statement
- Context Pack Project Brief draft

## FAQ

**"Is this too basic for senior engineers?"**
Senior engineers often skip structured inquiry because they assume they already know the problem. This workshop has caught misframed problems at every seniority level.

**"Do I need to bring a problem?"**
Recommended but not required. We provide sample scenarios for participants who do not have one.
