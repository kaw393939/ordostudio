# Workshop 8: Teach AI to Your Team

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Duration** | Full-day (6 hours) |
| **Audience** | Internal AI champions, L&D leaders, team leads responsible for AI adoption |
| **Human Edge** | Translation |
| **Prerequisites** | Responsible for or planning AI training for a team |
| **Max participants** | 16 |
| **Offer tier** | Offer 2 (developer accelerator) |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1. Apply the Feynman technique to test their own understanding before teaching
2. Design AI training sessions that manage cognitive load (Sweller)
3. Avoid the "curse of knowledge" — the expert's blind spot when teaching beginners
4. Build a 30-minute AI training curriculum with scaffolded exercises
5. Create pre/post assessments that measure actual comprehension (not satisfaction)
6. Write a Translation Brief that maps technical concepts to audience-appropriate representations

## Agenda

### Morning — Building the Substrate (40%)

| Time | Block | Format | Description |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:20 | Why Most AI Training Fails | Presentation | Cognitive load theory. The curse of knowledge. Why "showing them the tool" is not training. The Human Edge: Translation. |
| 0:20–0:50 | Feynman Exercise | Hands-on | Each participant explains an AI concept to a partner as if they had never heard of it. Partner gives feedback: "I understood / I didn't understand / I think I understand but I'm not sure." No AI. |
| 0:50–1:15 | Cognitive Load Mapping | Exercise | Map the intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load of a sample AI training session. Identify: what is inherently complex? What is just bad design? What actually produces learning? |
| 1:15–1:30 | Break | — | — |
| 1:30–2:15 | Audience Analysis | Exercise | Define the audience for your AI training: what do they already know? What scares them? What motivates them? What representation will they understand (visual, narrative, hands-on, example-based)? |
| 2:15–2:30 | Pre/Post Assessment Design | Presentation | Why satisfaction surveys are not assessment. How to measure whether someone actually learned. Pre/post survey design. |
| 2:30–3:00 | Lunch | — | — |

### Afternoon — Practicing the Real Workflow (60%)

| Time | Block | Format | Description |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 3:00–3:45 | Curriculum Design (AI-directed) | Hands-on | Using AI tools with Context Pack methodology, design a 30-minute AI training session for your specific team. Include: learning objectives, exercises, handouts, assessment. |
| 3:45–4:15 | Translation Brief | Exercise | Write a Translation Brief: for each technical concept in your session, specify the audience-appropriate representation and the scaffolding needed. |
| 4:15–4:30 | Break | — | — |
| 4:30–5:15 | Dry-Run Delivery | Live exercise | Each participant delivers a 5-minute excerpt of their training session. Peer evaluation using the Translation Brief rubric: did the audience understand? |
| 5:15–5:45 | Feedback + Revision | Individual | Incorporate peer feedback. Finalize curriculum, Translation Brief, and pre/post assessment. |
| 5:45–6:00 | Wrap-up | Presentation | Spell Book review. Richard Feynman: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Grace Hopper's nanosecond wire. |

## FAQ

**"I'm not a trainer."**
This workshop is for anyone responsible for AI adoption on their team. You do not need training experience — you need the willingness to help your colleagues learn.

**"Can I use these materials with my team immediately?"**
Yes. The curriculum, Translation Brief, and assessment are designed for immediate use. The dry-run in the workshop is practice for the real delivery.

**"What if my team is resistant to AI?"**
Resistance is usually a cognitive load problem or a trust problem. This workshop addresses both — by teaching you to design training that respects people's current understanding and builds from there.
