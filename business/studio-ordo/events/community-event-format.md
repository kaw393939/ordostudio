# EverydayAI — Community Event Format

## Overview

EverydayAI is Studio Ordo's community-facing training program. While the workshop catalog targets engineering teams and enterprise clients, EverydayAI brings practical AI literacy to local communities — small business owners, nonprofit staff, teachers, municipal employees, and anyone whose livelihood will be affected by AI but who has no engineering background.

**Core Belief:** AI literacy is not a luxury. The same frameworks that make enterprise teams effective — asking better questions, making accountable decisions, designing for failure — apply to a teacher writing lesson plans, a nonprofit director managing grants, or a small business owner evaluating software vendors.

**Home Base:** Newark, NJ (expandable to other metro areas)
**Format:** 3-hour community training session
**Frequency:** Monthly (first Saturday of each month)
**Pricing:** Free or sliding-scale ($0–$25)
**Capacity:** 20–40 participants per session

## Session Structure (3 Hours)

### Hour 1 — The Landscape (What Is Happening)

**Purpose:** Ground participants in what AI actually is, what it can do, and what it cannot do. Strip away hype and fear.

| Segment | Duration | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Welcome & introductions | 10 min | Name, what you do, one thing you've heard about AI |
| What AI actually is | 15 min | Pattern recognition, prediction, generation — no magic. Live demo of a real AI tool. |
| What AI cannot do | 10 min | The honest limits: no reasoning, no accountability, no judgment. |
| The acceleration brief | 10 min | Simplified version of the METR data: AI is getting better fast. What does that mean for your work? |
| Q&A | 15 min | Open questions. No question is too basic. |

**Key Message:** AI is a tool. Like every tool in history, it helps the skilled and harms the unprepared. Today we prepare.

### Hour 2 — The Practice (How to Use It)

**Purpose:** Hands-on practice with real AI tools applied to real tasks from participants' actual work.

| Segment | Duration | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| The 40/60 framework | 10 min | Simplified version: "You do the thinking (40%), AI does the production (60%)." What does this look like for a teacher? A small business? A nonprofit? |
| Live demo | 10 min | Facilitator demonstrates the framework with a real task selected from the room. |
| Hands-on practice | 30 min | Participants work on their own tasks with AI tools. Facilitator circulates. Pair people up if they are unfamiliar with the tools. |
| Share-out | 10 min | 3–4 participants share what they produced and what surprised them. |

**Key Message:** You are the expert in your domain. AI accelerates what you already know. If you ask bad questions, you get bad answers — and now you know how to ask better ones.

**Tools Available:**
- ChatGPT (free tier) or Claude (free tier) on participant devices
- Laptops available for participants who don't have one (Studio Ordo provides 10 loaners)
- Pre-made prompt templates for common tasks by profession:
  - Teachers: lesson plan generation, rubric drafting, parent communication
  - Small business: marketing copy, customer email responses, competitive research
  - Nonprofit: grant language drafting, impact report summaries, donor communication
  - Municipal: public communication drafts, meeting summaries, policy comparison

### Hour 3 — The Conversation (What It Means for You)

**Purpose:** Address the real concerns. Jobs, ethics, children, community impact.

| Segment | Duration | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Panel or group discussion | 20 min | Facilitated discussion on: Will AI take my job? How do I evaluate AI output? What should I watch out for? |
| The accountability principle | 10 min | Simplified Professional Judgment framework: "If you would not put your name on it without AI, do not put your name on it with AI." |
| Resources & next steps | 10 min | Take-home resource sheet, upcoming events, connection to paid workshops for those who want to go deeper. |
| Networking & close | 20 min | Informal conversation, snacks, one-on-one questions with facilitators. |

**Key Message:** You are not behind. You are starting today. That is enough.

## Audience Profiles

### Small Business Owners
- **Pain:** Competitors seem to be using AI and they are not.
- **Need:** Practical applications they can use this week. Marketing, customer service, operations.
- **Win condition:** Leave with one AI-assisted workflow they can repeat tomorrow.

### Nonprofit Staff
- **Pain:** Overwhelmed with reporting, grant writing, and communication — too few people, too much work.
- **Need:** Force multiplication. Draft faster, edit smarter, report more clearly.
- **Win condition:** Leave with a grant-language draft or impact summary produced in the session.

### Teachers
- **Pain:** AI is already in their classrooms (students are using it). They feel behind.
- **Need:** Understanding what AI can and cannot do, so they can set reasonable expectations for students and use AI themselves.
- **Win condition:** Leave with a lesson plan enhanced by AI and a framework for student AI use policies.

### Municipal Employees
- **Pain:** Pressure to "modernize" with no training budget and no clear direction.
- **Need:** Low-risk, practical starting points. Public communication, meeting notes, policy analysis.
- **Win condition:** Leave with a public communication draft and a clear understanding of what not to put into AI tools (PII, confidential data).

## Connection to Paid Offerings

EverydayAI is the community front door. It builds trust, demonstrates expertise, and creates natural paths to paid engagements:

| EverydayAI Experience | Paid Offering |
|----------------------|---------------|
| "I want to go deeper on AI for my team" | Workshop: Ask Better Questions or AI Accountability |
| "My company needs this for our engineers" | Team Program (6-week) |
| "I want to keep learning on my own" | Newsletter (The Ordo Brief) |
| "Can you come to our organization?" | Custom on-site workshop |
| "I want to build AI skills professionally" | Apprentice Program (when available) |

**The funnel is not manipulative.** EverydayAI provides genuine value at every session. Paid offerings exist for people who want more depth. The community training stands alone.

## Brand Integration

EverydayAI uses the Studio Ordo brand but with a warmer, more accessible tone:

- **Studio Ordo brand:** Swiss precision, corporate, anti-hype → for enterprise / workshops
- **EverydayAI tone:** Welcoming, clear, no jargon, patient → for community

**Tagline options:**
- "AI for the rest of us."
- "Start where you are."
- "No code required. No hype included."

**Visual:** Same Sage/Stone color palette, but with photography of real community participants (with permission), not stock images.
