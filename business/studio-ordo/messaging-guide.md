# Studio Ordo — Messaging Guide

## 1) Core message architecture

### Primary message
**Bring order to AI in software delivery.**

### Supporting messages (pick 1–2 per page)
- Spec-driven workflows for AI-augmented engineering.
- Evaluation gates that make AI outputs measurable.
- Training + apprenticeship designed for real teams.

### Proof line (use consistently)
- “20+ years teaching engineers · 10,000+ students”

## 2) CTA system (consistent verbs)

Use a small, consistent set of CTAs:
- **View training tracks**
- **Book a technical consult**
- **Join the studio**
- **Get the Ordo templates**

Rules:
- CTAs must be specific actions, not vague (“Learn more”).
- Primary CTA = one per screen.

## 3) Page-specific copy blocks

### Homepage hero (CTO/Eng Manager)
- Headline: Bring order to AI in software delivery.
- Subhead: Train your engineers to ship with AI using specs, tests, and evaluation gates.
- Proof: 20+ years teaching engineers · 10,000+ students

### Homepage hero (Individual)
- Headline: Vibe code with standards.
- Subhead: Learn a spec-driven method that turns AI speed into reliable delivery.
- Proof: 20+ years teaching engineers · 10,000+ students

### Studio section (apprenticeship)
Studio Ordo is a modern workshop. You’ll learn by shipping — and you’ll leave with artifacts that prove how you work.

## 4) Objections → responses

### “We already have AI tools.”
Tools don’t create standards. Ordo trains the workflow: specs, tests, evaluation, and review.

### “We tried AI and it made code quality worse.”
That’s a method problem. Ordo introduces evaluation gates and review conventions that keep quality stable.

### “Is this prompt engineering?”
No. Prompts are a detail. Ordo is an engineering operating system.

### “Will this replace engineers?”
No. Ordo is about accelerating engineers — with responsibility.

## 5) Persuasion ethics (Cialdini, applied responsibly)

We use persuasion to clarify truth, reduce uncertainty, and help buyers make informed decisions.

Allowed:
- Authority via real credentials and track record.
- Social proof via real outcomes/testimonials.
- Reciprocity via genuinely useful templates.
- Commitment via small steps (diagnostic, checklist).

Not allowed:
- Fake scarcity.
- Dark patterns (hidden pricing, confusing CTAs).
- Inflated claims (“10x guaranteed”, “instant mastery”).

## 6) Language rules

Do:
- “specs”, “tests”, “evaluation”, “review”, “audit”, “reliability”.
- “method”, “workflow”, “guardrails”.

Avoid:
- “magic”, “revolutionary”, “unlimited”, “automagical”.
- “AGI is here” style claims.

## 7) Naming conventions

- Programs and tracks should be noun-like and disciplined:
  - “Ordo Foundations”
  - “Ordo for Teams”
  - “Ordo Evaluation Lab”

Rule: short, memorable, not gimmicky.
