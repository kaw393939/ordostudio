## 1 — Brand Archetypes (Mark & Pearson)

### Primary: The Sage

| Dimension | Studio Ordo Expression |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Core desire** | Truth and understanding |
| **Goal** | Use intelligence and analysis to understand the world |
| **Fear** | Being duped, misled, or ignorant |
| **Strategy** | Seek out information and knowledge |
| **Gift** | Wisdom, intelligence |
| **Brand voice** | Calm, precise, evidence-backed, teacherly |
| **Shadow to avoid** | Ivory-tower detachment, condescension, analysis paralysis |

**Why Sage is primary.** Every foundational decision — anti-hype stance, proof-over-vibes, published research sources, "no claims without evidence" governance, the five named IP frameworks — expresses the Sage's conviction that *understanding is the path to power*. The Sage builds trust by being the most honest voice in the room. Studio Ordo's entire value proposition is: *we know what's true about AI and engineering, and we'll teach you.*

**Sage brand signals already in place:**
- Swiss International Typographic Style (clarity, precision, information hierarchy)
- Sourced statistics with tiered credibility ratings
- "We do not teach prompting. We teach the engineering operating system."
- The Spell Book (vocabulary as compression — rooted in Shannon's information theory)
- Brand governance requiring proof before claims

### Secondary: The Creator

| Dimension | Studio Ordo Expression |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Core desire** | Create something of enduring value |
| **Goal** | Give form to a vision |
| **Fear** | Mediocre vision or execution |
| **Strategy** | Develop artistic control and skill |
| **Gift** | Creativity, imagination |
| **Brand voice** | Craft-focused, artifact-producing, detail-aware |
| **Shadow to avoid** | Perfectionism, self-indulgence, disconnection from audience |

**Why Creator is secondary (not Explorer).** The brand guide originally identified Explorer as secondary, but the evidence points more strongly to Creator:

- The name "Ordo" means *order* — bringing structure and form to chaos
- Swiss design aesthetic = Creator's obsession with craft and execution
- "Artifacts over credentials" = Creator's belief that *the work speaks*
- Every engagement produces tangible deliverables (Context Packs, Spell Books, portfolios)
- The apprenticeship is a *bottega* — the Creator's workshop
- Gate projects are judged on craft quality, not completion

Explorer remains present in the apprentice journey (discovery, self-directed learning, freedom to chart your own path after Level 4), but the Creator archetype better captures what Studio Ordo *makes* and *values*.

### Supporting: The Hero

The Hero archetype activates specifically in the apprentice journey:

| Dimension | Studio Ordo Expression |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Core desire** | Prove one's worth through courageous action |
| **Goal** | Expert mastery to improve the world |
| **Fear** | Weakness, vulnerability, quitting |
| **Strategy** | Be as strong and competent as possible |

The gate projects, Demo Day, the "shipped work over certificates" philosophy, and the salary progression ($85K → $220K+) all express Hero energy. The apprentice is *on a hero's journey* — facing trials, gaining mastery, returning transformed.

**Archetype deployment by context:**

| Context | Lead Archetype | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Homepage / brand messaging | Sage | Build trust through intelligence |
| Workshop & team program sales | Sage + Creator | Demonstrate method + show artifacts |
| Studio / apprenticeship pages | Hero + Creator | Aspirational journey + craft mastery |
| Community / EverydayAI | Sage (gentle) | Wisdom without gatekeeping |
| Advisory / enterprise | Sage (authoritative) | Expert counsel |
| Newsletter (Ordo Brief) | Sage + Creator | Teach + show work |

## 2 — Cialdini's Seven Principles — Ethical Application

Studio Ordo's anti-hype commitment constrains how influence tactics may be used. The rule is: **every tactic must be genuine, verifiable, and in the audience's interest**. Manufactured scarcity, false consensus, and manipulative reciprocity are permanently banned.

### 2.1 Reciprocity

> *People feel obligated to return what they receive.*

**Studio Ordo application — lead with genuine generosity:**

| Tactic | Expression | Ethical check |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| EverydayAI community training | Free, quarterly, always free. No pitch at the event. | Value is real; no strings. ✓ |
| Lead magnets (Spell Book PDF, Context Pack Kit, Human Edge Scorecard) | Genuinely useful tools, not teasers | Must be complete and usable standalone. ✓ |
| Town Halls | Free monthly events with 40-minute Q&A | Q&A is the most valuable part. ✓ |
| Newsletter (Ordo Brief) | Teaches a concept every issue | Never pitch-first. Content leads. ✓ |
| Open-licensed EverydayAI materials | Anyone can reuse and teach from them | Generosity creates credibility. ✓ |

**What reciprocity builds:** When prospects encounter Studio Ordo through free value — a useful template, a clear-eyed article, an evening at EverydayAI — they carry a natural sense of goodwill that makes them receptive when a paid offering is later relevant to their needs.

**Guardrail:** Never give something "free" and then pressure for payment. The free offerings must be complete in themselves.

### 2.2 Commitment & Consistency

> *People align their behavior with prior commitments, especially public ones.*

**Studio Ordo application — design a graduated ladder of commitment:**

```
Newsletter signup (email only — lowest barrier)
    → Download a lead magnet (name + role)
        → Attend a Town Hall (2 hours of time)
            → Take the Human Edge Scorecard (self-assessment)
                → Book a consultation (1 hour + money)
                    → Workshop enrollment ($2,500+)
                        → Team program ($18K+)
                            → Advisory retainer ($35K+/mo)
                                → Studio apprenticeship (18 months)
```

Each step is small relative to the previous commitment, and each delivers value that justifies the next. The person who takes the Scorecard has *already identified their gap* — a consultation is a natural next step, not a pressure sell.

**Apprentice-specific commitment ladder:**
- Application → Accepted → Level 1 tuition → First gate → Level 2 → … → Demo Day
- Each gate is a public commitment (shipped artifact, reviewed by maestro)
- The field report is a monthly written commitment to reflection

**Guardrail:** Never trap people in commitments. Refund policies are clear. Unsubscribe is always one click. An apprentice can exit at any level with work they own.

### 2.3 Social Proof

> *People look to others' behavior to determine their own.*

**Studio Ordo application — show real evidence of real people:**

| Proof type | Current state | Development plan |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Statistics** | "23 years · 10,000+ engineers" | Verified and sourced ✓ |
| **Employer logos** | "Students at Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs" | From Keith's teaching career ✓ |
| **Apprentice outcomes** | Alex narrative (composite) | Needs real student stories |
| **Team program results** | Pre/post rubric scoring documented | Needs first corporate client data |
| **CEO urgency quotes** | Amodei, Altman, Huang, Pichai — all sourced | Ready to deploy ✓ |
| **Career outcomes** | Salary ranges with BLS/Glassdoor sources | Data backbone ready ✓ |
| **Testimonials** | Collection templates ready | No fabrication — ever. Collect as earned. |
| **Community size** | EverydayAI attendance targets | Track and publish when real |

**Social proof escalation by journey stage:**
1. **Awareness:** Market statistics (deployment gap, salary premium, METR data)
2. **Consideration:** Keith's credentials, employer logos, MIT RCT productivity data
3. **Decision:** Testimonials, case studies, live Demo Day recordings
4. **Retention:** Peer cohort activity, community engagement metrics

**Guardrail:** Never fabricate testimonials. Never imply endorsement. Testimonial placeholders remain until real ones are collected.

### 2.4 Authority

> *People defer to credible experts.*

**Studio Ordo application — Keith's credentials are the authority foundation:**

| Authority signal | Evidence |
|-----------------|---------|
| 23 years teaching at NJIT | Verifiable institutional record |
| 10,000+ students | Course enrollment records |
| 8 courses created, 15 sections/year | Institutional documentation |
| BS in Enterprise AI degree design | 49-page proposal, curriculum artifacts |
| Startup CTO (acquired) | Anthem Ventures acquisition record |
| Production portfolio | GitHub links, live URLs, Lighthouse scores |
| Sourced research in every document | MIT RCT, BLS, METR, SWE-bench — with citations |

**Authority without arrogance (Sage archetype constraint):**
- Authority is expressed through *evidence*, not titles or claims
- "I've watched 10,000 students graduate. I know what separates the ones who thrive from the ones who stall. It's not talent. It's method." — first-person, humble, specific
- The Swiss design aesthetic signals competence without loudness
- Source tiers (Tier 1: peer-reviewed, Tier 2: executive, Tier 3: practitioner) show intellectual rigor

**Guardrail:** Never inflate credentials. Never claim expertise beyond what's documented. If proof isn't available, use narrower language (governance policy).

### 2.5 Liking

> *People say yes to those they know and like.*

**Studio Ordo application — build genuine human connection:**

| Liking driver | Expression |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Similarity** | "I was a teacher, not a celebrity founder" — relatable origin |
| **Community investment** | Free training in Newark — demonstrates caring about real people |
| **Personal story** | TRS-80 at Christmas, AmeriCorps in Pittsburgh, Zambia consulting |
| **Anti-hype authenticity** | "We don't do hype" — engineers respect straight talk |
| **Complementary identity** | "Maestro" = conductor/teacher, not guru/boss |
| **Physical environment** | Swiss design = calm, clean, respectful of attention |

**The "Maestro" framing is a Liking strategy.** It positions Keith as a conductor-teacher who brings out the best in others, not a guru who demands followers. This is likeable because it's *about your success, not his status*.

**Guardrail:** The personal story must be genuine. Never manufacture relatability. The community investment must be sustained, not performative.

### 2.6 Scarcity

> *People value what is rare or diminishing.*

**Studio Ordo application — ONLY genuine, ethical scarcity:**

| Scarcity type | Expression | Why it's genuine |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Time scarcity (market)** | METR doubling at 2.9 months, SWE-bench 1.96%→81.42% | Real data, sourced, falsifiable |
| **Broadway analogy** | "1900 horses → 1913 automobiles → 13-year complete inversion" | Historical fact, applied as metaphor |
| **Capability window** | "The gap between what AI can do and what teams can use it for is growing" | The deployment gap is a measurable, documented phenomenon |
| **Apprentice cohort size** | Limited by maestro capacity (one maestro per ~6 apprentices) | Operational reality, not manufactured limited seats |
| **Keith's calendar** | Advisory engagements limited by actual available hours | One person's time is genuinely finite |

**Permanently banned:**
- ❌ Countdown timers with arbitrary deadlines
- ❌ "Only X spots left!" when spots are unlimited
- ❌ "Price increases tomorrow!" without genuine pricing change
- ❌ "This offer disappears" for evergreen content
- ❌ Manufactured waitlists for low-demand offerings

**The ethical scarcity position is itself a differentiator.** In an AI training market saturated with fake urgency, Studio Ordo's refusal to manufacture scarcity *is* a trust signal. The urgency is real: AI capability is doubling, and the window to build human judgment is closing. We don't need to fabricate what the data already shows.

### 2.7 Unity

> *People say yes to those they consider "one of us."*

**Studio Ordo application — build genuine shared identity:**

| Unity signal | Expression |
|-------------|-----------|
| **"We" language** | "We train what AI can't automate" — inclusive |
| **Studio identity** | Apprentices are *in the studio*, not *taking a course* |
| **Cohort bonds** | Apprentice levels progress together |
| **Newark roots** | Local community identity (EverydayAI is *for us*) |
| **Craft identity** | "Engineers who care about their craft" — tribal signal |
| **Alumni network** | Career Bridge creates ongoing connection |
| **Field reports** | Monthly reflections create shared narrative |
| **Newsletter** | "From the Studio" — dispatches from inside the community |

**Unity is the most powerful principle for retention and referral.** Once someone identifies as "a Studio Ordo person" — an engineer who values craft, evidence, and the human edge — they naturally refer others who share those values. The affiliate program succeeds when affiliates genuinely identify with the brand, not when they're chasing commissions.

**Guardrail:** Never create in-group/out-group hostility. "We value craft" does not mean "bootcamp grads are lesser." The identity is *aspirational and inclusive*, not exclusive and elitist.

## 3 — The Three Legal Relationships Through the Influence Lens

Our business operates through three distinct legal relationships. Each has a different influence profile:

### 3.1 Affiliate (B2B Referral Partner)

**Legal structure:** Independent business → W-9 → 25% lifetime commission on referred customer net value → 1099-NEC annually.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|------------|
| Reciprocity | Co-branded business cards, QR code landing pages, marketing assets. We invest in their success first. |
| Commitment | Graduated: sign up → first referral → first payout → regular referrals. Each success reinforces the next. |
| Social proof | Affiliate dashboard showing aggregate community referral activity. |
| Authority | The affiliate borrows Studio Ordo's brand authority (Sage credibility) while lending their own network trust (Liking). |
| Liking | Affiliates have their own independent business. Studio Ordo is on the back of their card, not the front. We respect their identity. |
| Scarcity | Not applicable — open program. No manufactured limits. |
| Unity | "Affiliate partners" = trusted allies, not salespeople. Shared values (craft, anti-hype) are the selection criterion, not volume targets. |

**Archetype for affiliates:** Sage + Explorer. They're knowledge-workers with their own practice who see Studio Ordo as an extension of their professional mission.

### 3.2 Apprentice (Educational Enrollment)

**Legal structure:** Tuition-paying student → structured 18-month curriculum → earns portfolio, not certificate.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|------------|
| Reciprocity | Application review, mentorship, field report feedback, career bridge access — all delivered before the apprentice has "paid back" anything. |
| Commitment | Monthly gate projects, field reports, public Demo Day. The apprentice publicly commits to growth at every stage. |
| Social proof | Cohort progress, alumni outcomes, Career Bridge placement rates. |
| Authority | Maestro supervision, named frameworks, institutional credibility. |
| Liking | Maestro-as-conductor framing. "I care about your growth" is the relationship. |
| Scarcity | Cohort size limited by maestro capacity (genuine). |
| Unity | The strongest unity signal. "I am a Studio Ordo apprentice" is an *identity*. |

**Archetype for apprentices:** Hero (primary) + Creator (secondary). They're on a transformative journey to prove mastery through shipped work.

### 3.3 Subcontractor (1099 Per-Engagement)

**Legal structure:** Independent contractor → defined scope/deliverable → 1099-NEC → maestro approval of work.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|------------|
| Reciprocity | Fair rates, clear scope, prompt payment after approval. |
| Commitment | Complete one engagement well → invited for more. |
| Social proof | Platform track record, client satisfaction data. |
| Authority | Studio Ordo's quality standards, maestro oversight. |
| Liking | Professional respect — clear expectations, no micromanagement. |
| Scarcity | Engagement availability tied to real client demand. |
| Unity | "Studio Ordo practitioners" — part of the professional network. |

**Archetype for subcontractors:** Creator. They're craftspeople who value doing quality work within a trusted system.

## 4 — Content Access Tiers Through the Archetype Lens

The four-tier access model maps to progressive archetype activation:

| Tier | Access | Price | Archetype Activated | Influence Engine |
|------|--------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Free** | Newsletter, EverydayAI, Town Halls, lead magnets | $0 | Sage (gentle) | Reciprocity, Authority |
| **AI-Assisted** | Curated content, templates, scorecard access, community forum | Low monthly | Sage + Creator | Commitment, Social Proof |
| **Human + AI** | Workshop enrollment, team programs, cohort learning, field reports | Mid monthly / per-engagement | Creator + Hero | Unity, Commitment |
| **Dedicated Human** | Advisory retainer, apprenticeship, 1:1 maestro access | Premium / retainer | Hero + Creator + Sage | Unity, Scarcity (genuine) |

**Progression logic:** Each tier adds more human contact and more personal investment. The archetype shifts from "learn from wisdom" (Sage) to "build something real" (Creator) to "prove yourself through action" (Hero). This mirrors the person's psychological journey from curiosity → commitment → transformation.

## 5 — Influence Ethics: The Anti-Patterns

These patterns are **permanently banned** regardless of revenue pressure:

| Anti-pattern | Why it's banned | What to do instead |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Fake scarcity timers | Violates anti-hype commitment; destroys Sage credibility | State genuine capacity limits truthfully |
| Fabricated testimonials | Fraudulent; undermines all social proof | Collect real testimonials as they're earned |
| "Guru" positioning | Shadow Sage (condescension); repels engineers | Maestro-conductor framing; evidence speaks |
| Poverty/fear messaging | "You'll be left behind if you don't act NOW" | Present data; let people draw their own conclusions |
| Upsell pressure at free events | Violates EverydayAI "no pitch" rule; destroys reciprocity | Offer the next step naturally; never push |
| Hidden fees or scope creep | Violates union pricing and transparency | Published prices; clear deliverable scope |
| Dark-pattern UX | Cookie manipulation, buried unsubscribe, forced continuity | One-click unsubscribe; clear pricing terms |
| Inflated credentials | "World's #1 AI training" or unverifiable superlatives | Specific, verifiable claims with sources |
| MLM/pyramid referral structures | Legal risk; ethical risk; brand destruction | Single-level affiliate with flat commission |

---

## 6 — Measuring Influence Effectiveness

Each principle should be tracked to ensure it's working *and* staying ethical:

| Principle | Metric | Healthy signal | Warning signal |
|-----------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Reciprocity | Lead magnet download → newsletter conversion rate | 30-40% | >60% (people feel obligated, not interested) |
| Commitment | Ladder progression rate (newsletter → Town Hall → consult) | 5-15% per step | <2% (content isn't compelling) or >30% (too aggressive) |
| Social proof | Testimonial collection rate, referral attribution | Steady growth | Static or declining (trust problem) |
| Authority | Inbound inquiry rate mentioning credentials/content | Growing | Declining (relevance fading) |
| Liking | Newsletter open rate, event return rate | >40% open, >50% return | <20% open (content isn't connecting) |
| Scarcity | Consultation fill rate, cohort waitlist (if genuine) | 70-90% fill | 100%+ persistent waitlist (capacity problem, not success) |
| Unity | Affiliate activation rate, apprentice retention | >80% apprentice retention | <60% (commitment failure) |

## 7 — Archetype Consistency Checklist

Use this checklist when creating any new content, page, or campaign:

- [ ] **Sage first:** Does this teach something true? Is every claim sourced or bounded?
- [ ] **Creator present:** Does this produce or reference a tangible artifact?
- [ ] **Hero earned:** If aspirational, does it show the *work* required, not just the reward?
- [ ] **Anti-hype clean:** Would an experienced engineer read this without cringing?
- [ ] **Genuinely useful:** Would this help someone even if they never buy anything?
- [ ] **Influence transparent:** If someone identified the tactic, would they respect it?
- [ ] **Swiss design aligned:** Clean, precise, content-forward, no ornamental noise?

If any answer is "no," revise before publishing.
