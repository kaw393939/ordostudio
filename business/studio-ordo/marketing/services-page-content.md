## Track 01 — Workshops

### Overview Section

**Headline:**
> Half-day and full-day workshops. One capability. Real artifacts.

**Body:**
> Each workshop focuses on one Human Edge capability. Participants work through real exercises using the Ordo method — spec-driven development with AI tools, structured around the 40/60 ratio. No slides-only sessions. No demo-watching. Every attendee leaves with artifacts they produced under professional conditions.

**What you leave with:**
- A Context Pack for the domain explored
- An AI Audit Log documenting your accept/reject/modify decisions
- 8+ Spell Book terms with working definitions
- A practical framework you can apply Monday morning

### Workshop Catalog

| # | Workshop Title | Human Edge Capability | Duration | Key Artifact |
|---|--------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | What Belongs to You | Disciplined Inquiry | Half-day | First Context Pack |
| 2 | The Audit Trail | Professional Judgment | Half-day | AI Audit Log |
| 3 | Build for the Break | Resilience Thinking | Full-day | Failure Mode Analysis |
| 4 | Finding the Real Problem | Problem Finding | Half-day | Problem Decomposition |
| 5 | What Your Data Cannot Say | Epistemic Humility | Half-day | Data Assumptions Doc |
| 6 | The Orchestration Workshop | Systems Thinking | Full-day | Agentic Workflow |
| 7 | Ship & Present | Accountable Leadership | Half-day | Demo Day Recording |
| 8 | Making AI Accessible | Translation | Half-day | Translation Brief |

### Who This Is For

**Persona 1 — The Engineering Manager**
> You have a team of 6–20 developers. AI tools are adopted unevenly. Some people use Copilot constantly; others don't trust it. You need a shared vocabulary and a measurable baseline.
>
> *Start with:* Workshop 1 (What Belongs to You) → Workshop 2 (The Audit Trail)

**Persona 2 — The VP of Engineering**
> You're responsible for AI adoption at scale. You need metrics, not vibes. You need to show the board that your investment in AI tooling is producing measurable improvements in delivery.
>
> *Start with:* Team Program (see below) → Advisory

**Persona 3 — The Individual Contributor**
> You write code every day. AI tools are everywhere. You want to know when to trust the output and when to override it. You want to be the person your team sends to figure out new approaches.
>
> *Start with:* Workshop 1 → Workshop 6 (The Orchestration Workshop)

### Pricing

| Format | Price | Includes |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Half-day workshop (up to 20) | $2,500 | Facilitator, materials, evaluation |
| Full-day workshop (up to 20) | $4,500 | Above + advanced exercises, extended artifacts |
| Additional participants (per person) | $125/$200 | Half-day/Full-day |

### FAQ

**"We already use AI tools. Why do we need training?"**
> Using AI tools and using them well are different things. 48% of AI projects fail to reach production. The gap is not tooling — it's judgment, evaluation, and accountability. That's what we train.

**"Can we customize the content for our domain?"**
> Yes. Every workshop includes a pre-engagement call where we adapt examples and exercises to your industry, tech stack, and team composition. The method stays the same. The domain changes.

**"What's the ROI?"**
> MIT's randomized controlled trial showed +40% faster task completion and +18% higher quality. Our workshops teach the same spec-driven, evaluation-focused methodology. We provide pre/post assessment data so you can measure your own results.

## Track 02 — Team Program (6 Weeks)

### Overview Section

**Headline:**
> Six weeks. Six capabilities. Measurable growth.

**Body:**
> The Team Program maps eight workshops into six weekly sessions. Each week focuses on one or two Human Edge capabilities, building on the previous week's artifacts. Pre/post Team Readiness Assessment provides quantitative evidence of improvement.

**Structure:**

| Week | Focus | Capability | Cumulative Artifacts |
|------|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Disciplined Inquiry | Context Pack v1 |
| 2 | Judgment | Professional Judgment | + AI Audit Log |
| 3 | Resilience | Resilience + Problem Finding | + Failure Mode Analysis |
| 4 | Data & Systems | Epistemic Humility + Systems Thinking | + Data Assumptions + Agentic Workflow |
| 5 | Leadership | Accountable Leadership | + Demo Day Recording |
| 6 | Integration | Translation + Review | + Translation Brief + Complete Portfolio |

**Team Readiness Assessment:**
> A 32-point assessment (4 points × 8 capabilities) administered before Week 1 and after Week 6. Provides a quantitative before/after that you can report to leadership.
>
> **Level 0** — No awareness of the capability
> **Level 1** — Can describe the capability
> **Level 2** — Can demonstrate the capability with support
> **Level 3** — Can demonstrate independently
> **Level 4** — Can teach the capability to others

**What you leave with:**
- Complete artifact portfolio (Context Pack, AI Audit Log, Failure Mode Analysis, Data Assumptions Document, Agentic Workflow, Demo Day Recording, Translation Brief)
- Pre/post Team Readiness Assessment scores
- Individual capability profiles for each team member
- Recommended next steps for continued development

### Who This Is For

> Teams of 6–20 engineers who need structured AI capability development with measurable outcomes. Ideal for organizations preparing for AI-integrated delivery, responding to compliance requirements around AI decision-making, or investing in retention through professional development.

### Pricing

| Format | Price |
|--------|-------|
| Team Program (up to 12) | $18,000 |
| Team Program (13–20) | $24,000 |
| Additional assessment rounds | $2,000 per round |

### FAQ

**"Six weeks feels fast. Can we go slower?"**
> Yes. We offer 8-week and 12-week cadences for the same curriculum. The content doesn't change — the spacing does.

**"Do participants need prior AI experience?"**
> No. The program starts from first principles. The MIT research shows the biggest gains come from the least-experienced participants.

**"Can we run this for multiple teams?"**
> Yes. We offer multi-team pricing and can run cohorts in parallel with a shared capstone session.

## Track 03 — Advisory

### Overview Section

**Headline:**
> We build your AI operating system.

**Body:**
> Advisory engagements are 1–3 month embedded partnerships. We work with your team to map AI workflows, establish guardrails, build playbooks, and train your people — all within your existing delivery process.

**What we build with you:**
- **Workflow mapping** — Where AI accelerates and where manual judgment is required
- **Guardrail design** — AI Audit Log templates, evaluation criteria, approval workflows
- **Playbook development** — Context Pack templates for your domain, prompt engineering standards
- **Capability training** — Targeted workshops integrated into your sprint cadence
- **Measurement** — Team Readiness Assessment, delivery metrics, quality metrics

### Who This Is For

> Engineering leadership at organizations with 50+ developers deploying AI tools at scale. You need more than training — you need an operating system for AI-integrated delivery.

### Pricing

> Custom engagement. Starting at $35,000/month.
