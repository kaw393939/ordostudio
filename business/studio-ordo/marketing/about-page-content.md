**Headline:**
> Built by a teacher. Powered by evidence.

**Subhead:**
> Studio Ordo exists because the gap between AI capability and human readiness is growing faster than any institution can respond. One person decided to close it.

## Section 01 — The Founder

**Section headline:**
> Keith Williams

**Professional photo placement:** [Hero-width, above the fold]

**Bio — long form:**

> Keith Williams has been teaching people to build software since before most of his students were born. He wrote his first program in 1983 on a Commodore 64. He's been writing them ever since.

> For 23 years, he taught at the New Jersey Institute of Technology — one of the country's top public research universities. He built the Web Systems concentration that became the foundation for modern web development education at NJIT. He designed and launched the Master of Science in Data Science program, which has graduated 200+ professionals now working at companies including Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs. He created the Bachelor of Science in Enterprise AI — the first undergraduate program of its kind, now with 300+ students enrolled.

> Along the way, he served as CTO at a startup that was acquired by Anthem Ventures. He consulted internationally in Zambia, building data systems in environments where nothing could be taken for granted — not power, not connectivity, not assumptions about how software "should" work. He earned a black belt in Taekwondo. He raised a family. He watched 10,000 students graduate.

> And he noticed something.

## Section 02 — The Origin Story

**Section headline:**
> What 10,000 graduates taught me.

**Body — first person voice:**

> "I've watched 10,000 students graduate from my programs. I've seen them go to Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and hundreds of companies in between. I know who thrives and who stalls.

> It's not the smartest students who succeed. It's the ones with method.

> The ones who can write a spec before they write code. The ones who test before they build. The ones who can explain what they built and why they built it that way. The ones who ship — not 'almost done,' but deployed, tested, and defended.

> When AI arrived, I saw the same pattern amplified. The students with method used AI as a force multiplier. The students without it used AI as a crutch. The gap widened.

> I built Studio Ordo to close that gap. Not with certificates or online courses. With the same approach that's worked for centuries: a workshop where you learn by producing real work under the guidance of someone who's done it 10,000 times.

> The frameworks aren't theoretical. They come from watching what actually works — in classrooms, in corporate teams, in international consulting, in startups. Every tool we teach, I've used. Every failure mode we train for, I've seen.

> I named it Ordo — Latin for order — because that's what's missing. The AI is here. The infrastructure is being built. What's missing is order: structured methods, professional vocabulary, and the discipline to evaluate what machines produce."

## Section 03 — The Philosophy

**Section headline:**
> What we believe.

**Principles (numbered list with brief expansion):**

**1. Method over talent.**
> Talent is distributed normally. Method is teachable. We teach method.

**2. Artifacts over credentials.**
> A portfolio of shipped work proves more than any certificate. Every engagement produces evaluable artifacts.

**3. Judgment over speed.**
> AI is fast. The question is whether the output is correct, appropriate, and responsible. We train the judgment to know.

**4. Vocabulary over vibes.**
> Professional vocabulary creates precision. Precision creates communication. Communication creates teams that ship.

**5. Evidence over hype.**
> We cite our sources. MIT RCT data, BLS projections, METR capability tracking, salary surveys. If we can't source it, we don't claim it.

**6. Accountability over completion.**
> Finishing is not enough. Can you explain what you built? Can you defend the decisions you made? Can you put your name on it?

## Section 04 — EverydayAI

**Section headline:**
> Where the community gathers.

**Body:**
> Before there was Studio Ordo, there was EverydayAI — a free community event that makes AI accessible to anyone. Monthly sessions. Three hours. No jargon. No sales pitch.

> EverydayAI exists because the AI transformation affects everyone — not just developers. Small business owners, nonprofit directors, teachers, municipal employees — everyone needs to understand what's changing and what they can do about it.

**Format:**
> - **Hour 1 — Landscape:** What's happening in AI right now (data, not speculation)
> - **Hour 2 — Practice:** Hands-on exercise with real tools (everyone builds something)
> - **Hour 3 — Conversation:** Open discussion, questions, community connection

**Audience profiles:**
> - Small business owners exploring AI for operations
> - Nonprofit directors with limited tech budgets
> - K-12 and higher ed educators adapting curriculum
> - Municipal employees modernizing public services

**Connection to Studio Ordo:**
> EverydayAI is a bridge. For most people, the community event is everything they need — a monthly check-in on AI capability that helps them make better decisions. For some, it reveals an appetite for deeper work. Those people find their way to workshops, team programs, or the studio.
>
> We don't pitch at EverydayAI events. The funnel is natural: attend a free event, discover you want more structure, explore paid offerings on your own terms.

## Section 05 — The Name

**Section headline:**
> Ordo.

**Body:**
> *Ordo* is Latin for order, arrangement, method. It appears in monastic traditions (the structured daily rhythm of work and study), in military history (the organized formation), and in typography (the orderly arrangement of elements on a page).

> We chose it because that's what we bring to AI adoption: order. Not restriction. Not bureaucracy. The productive kind of order — the kind that lets skilled people work faster, communicate precisely, and produce work they can defend.

> The visual identity follows the same principle. Swiss typographic tradition. Clean grids. No decoration. The content speaks. The brand stays out of the way.

## Section 06 — The Data

**Section headline:**
> Why now.

**Two-column data layout:**

**The acceleration:**
> - AI capability doubles every 3–4 months (METR, Feb 2026)
> - Language model benchmarks saturated in 12 months — tasks that took years to master
> - $600B+ in hyperscaler AI capital expenditure in 2026
> - Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO): "We are in the fastest technology transition in human history"

**The gap:**
> - Only 48% of AI projects reach production deployment
> - Traditional developer job postings down 51% (Indeed, 2023–2024)
> - AI-skill job postings up 68% (UMD Smith School, Q4 2022–Q4 2024)
> - Median AI engineer salary in NYC/NJ: $184K–$213K+ (Glassdoor, 2025)

**The parallel:**
> 1900 Fifth Avenue: horses, carriages, one automobile. 1913 Fifth Avenue: automobiles, no horses. Thirteen years. Complete inversion. No physical infrastructure barrier — only adoption speed.
>
> We are in 1901. The infrastructure is being built. The question is whether your people are ready.
