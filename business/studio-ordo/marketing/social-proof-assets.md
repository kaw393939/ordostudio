## Section 03 — One-Liners

Short-form copy for social media, email subject lines, presentation slides, and pull quotes.

### The Problem

- "48% of AI projects fail to reach production. The bottleneck isn't capability. It's people."
- "AI automates everything procedural. What remains is judgment."
- "Traditional developer postings: down 51%. AI-skill postings: up 68%. The market has decided."
- "The skill half-life in software engineering has compressed from 5 years to 18 months."
- "Everyone has AI tools. Almost no one has AI method."

### The Solution

- "Eight capabilities AI cannot replicate."
- "Spec → Tests → Build → Evaluate → Audit. That's the method."
- "Not a certificate. A portfolio of shipped work."
- "40% builds judgment. 60% builds velocity. 100% produces artifacts."
- "Professional vocabulary creates precision. Precision creates teams that ship."

### The Urgency

- "AI capability doubles every 3–4 months. Your training budget doesn't."
- "1900: horses. 1913: automobiles. We are in 1901."
- "The infrastructure is being built. The question is whether your team is ready."
- "$600 billion in AI infrastructure this year alone. The bet has been placed."
- "Thirteen years. Complete inversion. No barrier but adoption speed."

### The Offer

- "We train what AI can't automate."
- "Bring order to AI in software delivery."
- "Method over talent. Artifacts over credentials. Evidence over hype."
- "23 years. 10,000 engineers. Now open to your team."
- "The same method. Your domain. Monday morning."

## Section 04 — Historical Figure One-Liners

For use in newsletter issues, workshop slides, and social media. Each figure connects to a Human Edge capability.

| Figure | One-Liner | Capability |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Tim Berners-Lee | Refused to patent the web. Proved that open standards outlast proprietary ones. | Disciplined Inquiry |
| Ada Lovelace | Saw computation as creative expression 100 years before computers existed. | Problem Finding |
| Margaret Hamilton | Named "software engineering" by doing it under conditions where failure meant astronauts didn't come home. | Resilience Thinking |
| Alan Turing | Asked "Can machines think?" then built the framework to answer it. | Disciplined Inquiry |
| Grace Hopper | Built the first compiler because she was tired of writing the same code twice. | Systems Thinking |
| Edgar Codd | Gave the world relational databases. His employer tried to suppress the paper. | Epistemic Humility |
| Donald Knuth | Spent 50 years writing *The Art of Computer Programming* because he believed the craft deserved rigor. | Professional Judgment |
| Kent Beck | Proved that writing tests first produces better code than writing tests after — if it produces tests at all. | Professional Judgment |
| Linus Torvalds | Built Linux and Git. Two infrastructure projects that changed how the world builds software. | Systems Thinking |
| Claude Shannon | Proved that all information can be reduced to bits. One master's thesis. Changed everything. | Problem Finding |
| Donella Meadows | Taught the world to see systems, not parts. Her leverage points framework is still the best model for understanding where to intervene. | Systems Thinking |
| Geoffrey Hinton | Spent 40 years on neural networks when everyone said they were a dead end. Then proved everyone wrong. Now warns about the consequences. | Epistemic Humility |
| Richard Feynman | Could explain quantum physics to a first-year student. Believed that if you couldn't explain it simply, you didn't understand it. | Translation |
| Vint Cerf | Co-designed TCP/IP. Made the internet interoperable. Proved that standards enable more innovation than proprietary lock-in. | Systems Thinking |
| Douglas Engelbart | Demonstrated the mouse, hypertext, video conferencing, and collaborative editing in 1968. Called it "The Mother of All Demos." | Accountable Leadership |

## Usage Guidelines

- **Always cite sources** when using statistics externally
- **Never fabricate testimonials** — use templates as placeholders until real ones exist
- **Rotate one-liners** across social channels — don't repeat the same line within 30 days
- **Historical figure content** should always connect back to a Human Edge capability
- **Data visualizations** should use the brand color palette (to be defined in design system)
- **Quote cards** should include the speaker's photo when available (CEO cards), or Studio Ordo mark (founder cards)
