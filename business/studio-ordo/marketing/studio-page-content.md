## Section 01 — The Model

**Section headline:**
> The bottega model. Updated for the AI era.

**Body:**
> A bottega was a Renaissance workshop — the place where apprentices learned by producing real work under the guidance of a master craftsman. Leonardo da Vinci trained in Verrocchio's bottega not by attending lectures but by grinding pigments, preparing canvases, and eventually painting the angel that surpassed the master.

> Studio Ordo works the same way. You learn by shipping. Every level produces artifacts — real, evaluable, portfolio-ready work that demonstrates capability. There are no multiple-choice exams. There's no seat time requirement. Progress is measured by what you produce, judged against professional standards.

> The maestro (Keith Williams, 23 years, 10,000+ students) provides structured guidance, code review, project feedback, and the "invisible curriculum" — the professional vocabulary, judgment patterns, and failure modes that only come from experience.

## Section 02 — The Journey

**Section headline:**
> Alex's story.

**Body — narrative (first-person-adjacent):**

> **Month 1.** Alex joined the studio as a junior developer with 2 years of experience and a computer science degree. They could write React components and follow tutorials. They had never written a spec, never run a CI pipeline from scratch, and their idea of testing was "it works when I click it."

> **Month 3.** Alex shipped their first two gate projects — a professional portfolio site built without frameworks (hand-crafted HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript) and an Anatomy & Physics simulation with 100% test coverage and a CI/CD pipeline. They started keeping an AI Audit Log. Their Context Pack was rough but real. They had 15 Spell Book terms they could actually define.

> **Month 6.** Journeyman level. Alex shipped a Design Curator Cards project using the autodidactic loop — Orient, Map, Vocabulary, Evidence, Synthesize. They chose a topic they knew nothing about, produced 30 evidence-backed cards, and had a Named Expert review their synthesis. They were learning how to learn, not just how to code.

> **Month 10.** Alex merged a feature into an existing production codebase, wrote a Failure Mode Analysis, and survived an unannounced 30-minute incident drill. They handled a P2 gracefully. Their Context Pack was on version 3. They had 35 Spell Book terms.

> **Month 14.** Senior Journeyman. Alex built an agentic orchestration toolkit from scratch — SOLID architecture, Command pattern, dependency injection, 10 orchestration principles. Then deployed a production platform with Terraform, Ansible, Docker Compose, and Traefik. They wrote a STRIDE threat model. They could design for failure, not just respond to it.

> **Month 18.** Maestro Candidate. Alex delivered a real client project — a knowledge graph with human-in-the-loop evaluation and a production harness. They presented at Demo Day, defending technical decisions under questioning for 20 minutes. Then they ran a community AI training event — 22 participants, NPS of 64, curriculum they designed using the Feynman technique.

> **Today.** Alex's portfolio: 8 shipped projects, 60+ Spell Book terms, a Context Pack that reads like a senior engineer's operating manual, and an AI Audit Log with hundreds of documented accept/reject/modify decisions. Not a certificate. Evidence.

## Section 03 — The Levels

**Section headline:**
> Four levels. Clear progression. No ambiguity.

| Level | Title | Months | Human Edge Focus | Gate Projects | Spell Book | 40/60 Ratio |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Apprentice | 1–3 | Disciplined Inquiry, Professional Judgment | Portfolio Site, Anatomy & Physics | 15 terms | 70/30 (more manual) |
| 2 | Journeyman | 4–8 | Problem Finding, Resilience Thinking | Design Curator Cards, Humanities & Computation | 30 terms | 50/50 (balanced) |
| 3 | Senior Journeyman | 9–14 | Epistemic Humility, Systems Thinking | Agentic Toolkit, Production Deploy | 45 terms | 35/65 (more AI) |
| 4 | Maestro Candidate | 15–18+ | Accountable Leadership, Translation | Client Project, Community Training | 60+ terms | 20/80 (AI-primary) |

**Context Pack evolution:**

| Level | Context Pack Version | What It Contains |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | v1 — Starter | Project brief + domain context |
| 2 | v2 — Structured | + evaluation criteria + agent instructions |
| 3 | v3 — Complete | + failure modes + orchestration specs |
| 4 | v4 — Production | Full operating document with prior context chain |

## Section 04 — Gate Projects

**Section headline:**
> Eight projects. Each one proves a capability.

### Level 1 — Apprentice

**Gate 1: Professional Portfolio Site**
> Hand-crafted HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks. No templates. You build every element from scratch to prove you understand what the framework abstracts away.
>
> *Proves: Disciplined Inquiry — you can build from first principles.*

**Gate 2: Anatomy & Physics**
> A cross-disciplinary exploration. You will model a biological system using physics engines or mathematical proofs. The point is to bridge two distinct fields and prove you can synthesize knowledge across boundaries.
>
> *Proves: Polymathic Synthesis — you can connect disparate domains.*

### Level 2 — Journeyman

**Gate 3: Design Curator Cards**
> Choose an unfamiliar topic. Research it using the autodidactic loop. Produce 30 evidence-backed cards. Have a Named Expert critique your synthesis. Document everything in CURATOR_NOTES, AGENTS.md, PROMPT_LOG, and CLAIMS.md.
>
> *Proves: Problem Finding — you can investigate new domains systematically.*

**Gate 4: Humanities & Computation**
> Merge computational analysis with a humanities discipline (literature, history, philosophy). Build a tool that analyzes texts, maps historical events, or models philosophical arguments.
>
> *Proves: Cross-Domain Inquiry — you can apply technical skills to humanistic problems.*

### Level 3 — Senior Journeyman

**Gate 5: Agentic Orchestration Toolkit**
> Build from scratch using SOLID principles, Command pattern, and dependency injection. Implement the 10 Core Orchestration Principles. Document every data assumption. Capstone: add a new command type from scratch in under 4 hours.
>
> *Proves: Systems Thinking — you can design and orchestrate complex systems.*

**Gate 6: Production Deployment Platform**
> Terraform + Ansible + Docker Compose + Traefik. Defense-in-depth (6 layers). STRIDE threat model. AGENT_HANDOFF.md documenting every AI-assisted infrastructure decision.
>
> *Proves: Epistemic Humility — you know where your systems can fail and plan for it.*

### Level 4 — Maestro Candidate

**Gate 7: Client Project Delivery**
> A real client. A real problem. Build a solution with knowledge graph + human-in-the-loop evaluation + production harness. Present at Demo Day — 20-minute defense of technical decisions under questioning.
>
> *Proves: Accountable Leadership — you can ship, present, and defend.*

**Gate 8: Community AI Training Event**
> Design a curriculum using the Feynman technique and cognitive load theory. Run a dry run with 5 observers. Then run a live event — 15+ participants, real NPS collection, post-event survey.
>
> *Proves: Translation — you can make the complex accessible to anyone.*

## Section 06 — The CEO of Agents

**Section headline:**
> You're not learning to code. You're learning to direct.

**Body:**
> By Level 3, you spend 65% of your time directing AI agents and 35% doing manual exploration. By Level 4, it's 80/20. You're not a coder who uses AI. You're an engineer who orchestrates AI — evaluating output, managing context, making judgment calls, and taking responsibility for outcomes.

> This is what the market pays a premium for. Not the ability to prompt. The ability to direct, evaluate, and ship.

> The Context Pack is your operating document. The AI Audit Log is your decision trail. The Spell Book is your professional vocabulary. Together, they make you the CEO of your AI agents — accountable, structured, and effective.
