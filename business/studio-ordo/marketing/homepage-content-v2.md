## Section 01 — The Human Edge

**Section headline:**
> Eight capabilities AI cannot replicate.

**Body (2 sentences):**
> AI automates everything procedural. What remains is judgment, inquiry, resilience, and the ability to take responsibility for outcomes. These are not soft skills. They are the hard skills of the AI era.

**Capability grid (2×4 or 1×8):**

| Capability | One-liner |
|-----------|-----------|
| Disciplined Inquiry | Ask the question that changes the project |
| Professional Judgment | Override the confident machine when you should |
| Resilience Thinking | Design for what breaks at 2 AM |
| Problem Finding | Find the real problem, not the stated one |
| Epistemic Humility | Know what your data cannot represent |
| Systems Thinking | See how the parts interact where complexity hides |
| Accountable Leadership | Ship, present, defend — put your name on it |
| Translation | Make the complex accessible to anyone |

## Section 02 — Method

**Section headline:**
> Spec → Tests → Build → Evaluate → Audit

**Body:**
> The Ordo method uses the same workflow AI-capable teams use in production. 40% builds judgment — manual work that teaches you what the machine is doing. 60% builds velocity — directing AI agents with structured context. 100% produces artifacts that prove how you work.

**Method steps (visual timeline or numbered):**

1. **Spec** — Write a Context Pack: project brief, domain context, evaluation criteria, prior context
2. **Tests** — Define acceptance criteria before building (TDD)
3. **Build** — 40% manual exploration, 60% AI-assisted implementation
4. **Evaluate** — Automated quality measurement (not just "does it work?")
5. **Audit** — AI Audit Log documenting accept/reject/modify decisions with reasoning

**Proof point:**
> MIT randomized controlled trial: +40% faster task completion, +18% higher quality. Biggest gains for least-experienced workers.

## Section 03 — Outcomes

**Section headline:**
> Results that compound.

**Three-column layout:**

**For Teams**
> Delivery throughput with AI accountability. Your team produces more — and can prove every decision to compliance, legal, or a board.
>
> MIT RCT: +40% faster, +18% higher quality.

**For Individuals**
> Career acceleration at AI-premium rates. Engineers with these skills earn $110K–$350K+ depending on experience and capability depth.
>
> Entry AI roles: $110K–$150K. Senior: $180K–$350K+. Staff: $300K–$500K+.

**For Leaders**
> Only 48% of AI projects reach production. The bottleneck is not capability — it's people who can ship, evaluate, and take responsibility. Our graduates close that gap.

## Section 05 — Studio

**Section headline:**
> Not a certificate. A portfolio of shipped work.

**Body (3 paragraphs):**
> The Studio Ordo apprenticeship is a 12–18 month guided progression from working developer to AI-capable engineer. Four levels, eight gate projects, and a growing portfolio of artifacts that demonstrate capability to any employer or client.

> Alex joined the studio as a junior developer with 2 years of experience and a computer science degree. Eighteen months later: 8 shipped projects, a Demo Day recording where they defended technical decisions under questioning, and a community AI training event with 22 participants and an NPS of 64.

> The studio works like a bottega — the Renaissance workshop model. You learn by shipping. You grow by producing artifacts under the guidance of an experienced maestro.

**Level progression (horizontal timeline):**

| Level | Title | Months | What You Ship |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Apprentice | 1–3 | Portfolio + Anatomy & Physics |
| 2 | Journeyman | 4–8 | Curator Cards + Humanities & Computation |
| 3 | Senior Journeyman | 9–14 | Agentic Toolkit + Production Deploy |
| 4 | Maestro Candidate | 15–18+ | Client Project + Community Training |

## Section 06 — Proof

**Section headline:**
> The data is clear.

**Two-column layout:**

**Left column — The Founder**
> Keith Williams. 23 years at NJIT. 10,000+ students taught. Built the Web Systems program, the MS Data Science program (200+ graduates), and the BS in Enterprise AI (300+ students enrolled). CTO at a startup acquired by Anthem Ventures. International consulting in Zambia. Programming since 1983.
>
> "I've watched 10,000 students graduate. I know what separates the ones who thrive from the ones who stall. It's not talent. It's method."

**Right column — The Acceleration**
> AI capability doubles every 3–4 months (METR, Feb 2026).
> Traditional developer job postings: down 51% (Indeed, 2023–2024).
> AI-skill postings: up 68% (UMD Smith School, Q4 2022–Q4 2024).
> $600B+ in hyperscaler AI investment in 2026 alone.
>
> *The infrastructure is being built. The question is whether your team is ready.*
