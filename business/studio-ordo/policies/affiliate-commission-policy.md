# Studio Ordo — Affiliate / Referrer Commission Policy

**Owner:** Keith Williams · **Last updated:** 2025-07-14

## Three Distinct Legal Relationships

Studio Ordo operates through three legally separate relationships. This policy governs
the first (Affiliate). See `contractor-policy.md` for Subcontractor terms and
`../studio/apprentice-journey.md` for Apprentice enrollment.

| Relationship | Nature | Compensation | Tax Treatment |
|-------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Affiliate** | B2B referral partnership | 25% lifetime commission on referred customer net value | W-9 required; 1099-NEC issued annually |
| **Apprentice** | Educational enrollment | Tuition-paying student; earns portfolio, not paycheck | Tuition paid by apprentice |
| **Subcontractor** | Per-engagement contractor | Negotiated rate for defined deliverable; maestro approval required | W-9 required; 1099-NEC issued annually |

These relationships may overlap: a person can be an affiliate AND an apprentice AND
a subcontractor simultaneously. Each relationship is governed independently.

## Affiliate Program — Summary

Affiliates are independent business owners who refer clients to Studio Ordo. They have their
own website, their own clients, and their own professional identity. Studio Ordo appears on
the *back* of their business card — their brand comes first.

This is a **single-level referral program**. There is no multi-level component. Affiliates
earn commission only on clients they directly refer — not on referrals made by people they
introduced. This is not MLM.

## Commission Rate

**25% of lifetime net collected revenue** from each referred customer.

- "Lifetime" means: every engagement the referred customer completes with Studio Ordo, in perpetuity,
  as long as the affiliate relationship remains in good standing.
- "Net collected revenue" means: total payments received minus refunds, chargebacks, and payment
  processing fees.
- The 25% rate applies uniformly. No tiered or volume-based commission structures.
- Rate changes require 90-day advance written notice to all active affiliates and apply only
  to *new* referrals after the effective date. Existing referral relationships are grandfathered.

---

## Attribution Rules

- Referrer is recorded at intake conversion time via attributed referral link or QR code.
- Attribution uses a 90-day cookie window. If a prospect visits an affiliate's referral link
  and converts within 90 days, the affiliate receives credit.
- First-touch attribution: the first affiliate link that brought the prospect wins.
- Maestro assignment may choose any best-fit provider — affiliate commission is paid regardless
  of which provider is assigned (unless fraud/abuse).
- Disputed attribution is resolved by the maestro with final authority.

## Payment Timing

1. Client completes a paid engagement → deal reaches DELIVERED status
2. Commission ledger row created: status = **EARNED** (25% of net collected)
3. Maestro reviews and approves → status = **APPROVED**
4. Payout processed in next payment cycle → status = **PAID**

Commission is **not earned at payment time** — it is earned after delivery completion.
This protects against paying commission on work that is later refunded.

---

## Refund Effects

- Full refund: commission ledger row is voided (EARNED → VOIDED)
- Partial refund: commission is recalculated on the reduced net amount
- If commission has already been paid (PAID status), the overpayment is deducted from
  the affiliate's next payout cycle

---

## Affiliate Obligations

- Complete W-9 before receiving any payout
- Represent Studio Ordo honestly and in accordance with brand guidelines
- No guarantees of specific outcomes (consistent with anti-hype policy)
- No spam, unsolicited bulk messaging, or misleading advertising
- Maintain their own independent business (this is a B2B relationship)

## What Studio Ordo Provides

- Unique referral link and QR code with attribution
- Co-branded business card templates (affiliate's brand front, Studio Ordo back)
- Marketing assets consistent with brand guidelines
- Affiliate dashboard: referral tracking, commission status, payout history
- Prompt, transparent communication about referred client outcomes

## Termination

Either party may terminate the affiliate relationship with 30 days' written notice.
Upon termination:
- Commissions already EARNED or APPROVED are still paid out
- No new referral attributions are recorded
- Existing referred customer relationships continue to generate commission for 12 months
  after termination date (honoring the "lifetime" commitment for a wind-down period)

## Compliance

- This program is a single-level affiliate/referral arrangement, not a business opportunity
  under FTC guidelines or state business opportunity disclosure laws
- No required purchases, no inventory, no minimum referral targets
- Affiliates are not employees, agents, or representatives of Studio Ordo
- All marketing materials must comply with FTC endorsement guidelines (16 CFR Part 255)
- State-specific disclosure requirements are the affiliate's responsibility for their own marketing
