# Studio Ordo — Communications Boundary (Client/Provider)

## Goal
Protect apprentices and clients with clear channels and documented decisions.

## Policy
- Client communications for deals should be captured in a platform-visible channel (or summarized as notes).
- Apprentices should not be pressured into off-platform scope or payment changes.
- Maestro/admin is the escalation path.

## Required practices (MVP)
- Each deal has:
  - a kickoff note
  - weekly status note (for multi-week offers)
  - completion note
