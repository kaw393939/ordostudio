## Summary
- Studio Ordo sets standardized offer prices.
- The goal is predictable scope, fair pay, reduced negotiation load, and consistent client experience.

## Pricing governance
- Owner: Keith Williams (LLC operator) with input from maestros.
- Changes require:
  - documented rationale
  - effective date
  - backward-compatibility rules for in-flight deals

## Allowed pricing changes
- Adjust price per offer SKU
- Adjust platform fee / commission percentages
- Create limited-time promotions (optional; must remain ethical)

## Disallowed
- Hidden fees
- Surprise scope charges without explicit change order

## Commission defaults
- Referral commission is a configurable percentage.
- Provider payout rules should be deterministic and ledgered.
