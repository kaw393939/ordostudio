# Studio Ordo — Data Provenance Policy

## Why
Studio Ordo’s credibility depends on traceable claims.

## Provenance rules
- Editorial claims must link to provenance:
  - field report ids
  - research sources (URLs)
  - transcript/video references (when used)

## Minimum viable provenance (MVP)
- Provenance stored per newsletter section or per content block.
- Editing content must not discard provenance metadata.

## Escalation
- If a claim cannot be tied to provenance, rewrite or remove it.

## Data ingestion notes
- Crawled sources must store:
  - fetch timestamp
  - canonical URL
  - snapshot hash (optional)
