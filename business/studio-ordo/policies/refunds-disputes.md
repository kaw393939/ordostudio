# Studio Ordo — Refunds & Disputes Policy (Platform-Controlled)

## Summary
- Refund decisions are made by the platform operator (Keith Williams' LLC) via authorized admins.
- Apprentices/providers do not negotiate refunds directly with clients.

## Refund goals
- Protect client trust.
- Protect apprentices from chaotic scope creep.
- Preserve platform credibility through consistent decisions.

## Standard refund rules (MVP)
- Upfront payment is required.
- Refunds are discretionary based on:
  - delivery status
  - documented scope adherence
  - client cooperation (attendance, access, responsiveness)
  - severity of platform/provider failure

## Refund types
- Full refund
- Partial refund
- Credit (optional; only if explicitly supported)

## Required process
1) Create internal case note (deal id, offer, timeline)
2) Review artifacts (call notes, deliverables, follow-up actions)
3) Decide refund outcome
4) Execute via payment processor
5) Record audit log entry (who/why/amount)
6) Update ledgers (commission/payout eligibility)

## Dispute handling
- If payment processor dispute occurs:
  - freeze payouts for the deal
  - gather evidence packet: offer description, deliverables, comms
  - respond within processor SLA

## Apprentice protection
- If client behavior is abusive or unsafe, the platform may terminate delivery and decide refund outcome.
