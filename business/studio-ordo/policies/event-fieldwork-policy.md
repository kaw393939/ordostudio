# Studio Ordo — Event Fieldwork Policy (Apprentices)

## Purpose
Fieldwork is a growth and marketing loop: apprentices attend NYC tech events, build relationships, and capture insights.

## Card/QR behavior
- Apprentices represent themselves as independent consultants affiliated with Studio Ordo.
- No inflated claims; follow proof policy.

## Reporting requirements
- After an event, apprentice submits a structured field report:
  - key insights
  - models/money/people takeaways
  - what they tried
  - client advice
  - follow-up actions

## Safety
- Escalate uncomfortable situations.
- Do not collect sensitive personal data.
