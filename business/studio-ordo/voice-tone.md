# Studio Ordo — Voice & Tone

## 1) Voice (stable)

Studio Ordo voice is:
- **Precise**: structured, unambiguous, engineered.
- **Calm**: no hype, no anxiety marketing.
- **Capable**: speaks like a senior practitioner.
- **Inviting**: welcomes learners; respects experts.

## 2) Tone ladder (contextual)

### A) CTO/Eng Manager
- Tone: executive-technical.
- Focus: risk, standards, measurable outcomes.
- Avoid: tutorials-in-public, slang.

### B) Individual professional
- Tone: mentor + craft.
- Focus: confidence through method, portfolio artifacts.
- Avoid: shame (“you’re behind”).

### C) Studio members

## 3) Writing mechanics

- Prefer short sentences.
- Use lists and numbered sections.
- One claim per paragraph.
