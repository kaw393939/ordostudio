# Career Bridge Program

## Mission

Connect Studio Ordo apprentice graduates with employers who value AI-capable engineers. Not a staffing agency. A curated introduction between vetted talent and organizations that understand what the portfolio represents.

## How It Works

### For Apprentices

```
Complete Gate Projects → Build Portfolio → Enter Career Bridge → Get Introduced → Land Role
```

1. **Eligibility:** Complete Level 2 (Journeyman) or higher in the Studio Ordo apprenticeship
2. **Portfolio review:** Keith reviews portfolio for completeness and quality before Career Bridge activation
3. **Profile creation:** Standardized profile highlighting capabilities, artifacts, and role readiness
4. **Network introduction:** Matched with employers based on role requirements, location, and capability fit
5. **Interview preparation:** Mock technical interviews, portfolio presentation coaching, compensation negotiation guidance
6. **Placement support:** Active support through interview process — not just a referral, but follow-through

### For Employers

```
Join Network → Define Needs → Review Profiles → Interview Candidates → Hire
```

1. **Join the employer network:** Free registration, describe your team's needs and hiring timeline
2. **Receive curated profiles:** Only candidates who match your requirements — no resume spam
3. **Review portfolios:** Every candidate has a visible, evaluable body of work (not just a resume)
4. **Interview with confidence:** You know exactly what each candidate can do before the first call
5. **Hire with support:** 90-day check-in after placement to ensure fit

- Job postings shared with Studio Ordo apprentices
- No fees, no commitment

**Tier 2 — Preferred Employer ($2,500/year)**
- All Tier 1 benefits
- Priority access to graduating apprentices
- Logo on Studio Ordo employer partner page
- Quarterly talent pipeline briefing (who's in the studio, when they'll graduate)

### Placement Terms

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Placement fee** | 10% of first-year base salary (industry standard for curated placements is 15–25%) |
| **Payment timing** | Due 30 days after candidate's start date |
| **Guarantee** | If placement doesn't work out within 90 days, fee is refunded in full |
| **No exclusivity** | Candidates may also be pursuing roles independently |
| **No non-compete** | Employers may hire Studio Ordo graduates directly after the initial introduction — we don't lock anyone in |

**Why 10%:** We're not a staffing agency. We're an educational institution that produces talent. The placement fee covers Career Bridge operations and cycles revenue back into community programs. 10% keeps it accessible while making the program sustainable.

## Ethical Commitments

1. **No lock-in.** Apprentices are free to find jobs through any channel. Career Bridge is a service, not a requirement.
2. **No data selling.** Apprentice profiles are shared only with the apprentice's explicit consent, to specific employers, for specific roles.
3. **Transparent pricing.** The 10% fee is published. Apprentices know the terms. Employers know the terms. No hidden costs.
4. **Quality over quantity.** We'd rather place 4 apprentices in excellent roles than 20 in mediocre ones. Every placement reflects on the program.
5. **Honest assessment.** If an apprentice isn't ready for a role, we tell them. If an employer isn't a good fit, we say so. The Career Bridge protects both sides.
