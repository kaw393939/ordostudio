# Corporate Training Packages

## Overview

Three tiers of corporate training, each built on the same Human Edge framework and Ordo method. Published pricing. No hidden fees. No "call for pricing" on standard offerings.

**Pricing philosophy:** Union pricing. The rates are posted. Everyone pays the same. Volume discounts are structured and transparent. If you can't afford it, we'll point you to the free community programs — no judgment.

## Pricing Justification

### Value Delivered, Not Time Spent

The pricing reflects outcomes, not hours:

**Starter ($2,000):**
> One capability. One shared vocabulary. One set of artifacts. Your team can apply what they learned Monday morning. Compare to: one day of lost productivity from a bad AI deployment costs more than $2,000.

**Professional ($5,000):**
> Two capabilities. Measurable before/after. Written report for leadership. Compare to: MIT RCT shows +40% faster task completion with proper AI method. For a team of 15 engineers at $150K average salary, that's $1.5M in annual productivity. $5,000 is the rounding error.

**Enterprise ($10,000):**
> Full framework. Individual profiles. Demo Day evidence. Quarterly tracking. Compare to: the average failed AI project costs $1.3M. One successful deployment pays for this program 130 times over.

### Volume and Repeat Pricing

| Scenario | Discount |
|----------|---------|
| 2 packages booked together | 10% off total |
| 3+ packages booked together | 15% off total |
| Annual agreement (4+ engagements) | 20% off total |
| Nonprofit organizations | 25% off any package |
| Referred by EverydayAI alumnus | $250 credit |
