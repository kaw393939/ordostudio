## Structure

| Element | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Welcome + housekeeping | 5 minutes | Logistics, recording notice, ground rules |
| Presentation | 20 minutes | One focused topic, data-driven, no fluff |
| Live demo or exercise | 10 minutes | Something the audience does, not just watches |
| Q&A + discussion | 40 minutes | Open format, honest answers, real conversation |
| Wrap-up + next steps | 5 minutes | Resources, next Town Hall date, newsletter plug |
| **Total** | **80 minutes** | |

### Ground Rules (Stated at Every Session)
1. No jargon without explanation
2. No hype — every claim has a source
3. No sales pitch — Town Halls are informational, not promotional
4. Questions are welcome at any point (use chat for virtual, raise hand for in-person)
5. Recording is posted publicly unless someone objects (opt-out respected immediately)

## Facilitator Notes

### Presentation Style
- **Data first.** Every claim has a source. Show the source on screen.
- **No selling.** Mention Studio Ordo programs once at the end, as "if you're interested in going deeper." That's it.
- **Honest uncertainty.** "I don't know" is a valid answer. "Here's what the data says" is better than "I think."
- **Engage early.** Ask the audience a question in the first 3 minutes. Don't lecture for 20 minutes then ask for questions.
- **Manage time ruthlessly.** The Q&A is the most valuable part. Cut the presentation short if necessary, never cut the Q&A.

### Guest Speaker Guidelines
- Invited for specific expertise (not celebrity)
- Briefed on anti-hype voice: no product pitches, no company propaganda
- Encouraged to share real experiences, including failures
- Given the same data-first, source-your-claims standard

### Apprentice Involvement
- Level 3+ apprentices can moderate chat and manage logistics
- Level 4 Maestro Candidates can co-present on topics related to their gate projects
- September Demo Day preview is apprentice-led
- Apprentice involvement is a scaling mechanism — more facilitators, more events
