# EverydayAI — Community AI Training Program

## Mission

Free AI literacy for Newark and surrounding communities. No jargon. No sales pitch. Honest answers about what AI can and cannot do, delivered by people who build AI systems for a living.

EverydayAI exists because the AI transformation affects everyone — not just developers. Small business owners, nonprofit directors, teachers, municipal employees, and residents all need to understand what's changing and what they can do about it.

## Program Format

### Structure
- **Duration:** 4 weeks, one evening per week
- **Session length:** 2 hours (6:00 PM – 8:00 PM)
- **Cohort size:** 15–30 participants
- **Cost:** Free. Always.
- **Frequency:** Quarterly (4 cohorts per year)
- **Registration:** Through LMS events system

### Week 1 — What AI Is and Isn't

**Objective:** Participants can distinguish AI capability from AI hype and identify one area where AI could help their work.

**Hour 1 — Demos and Reality Check**
- Live demonstration of 3 AI tools (text generation, image analysis, data summarization)
- "What did it get right? What did it get wrong?" — group evaluation exercise
- Common misconceptions addressed directly:
  - "AI understands what I'm saying" → No. It predicts tokens.
  - "AI will replace my job tomorrow" → Some tasks, yes. Your judgment, no.
  - "AI is always right" → It's confidently wrong more often than you think.

**Hour 2 — Hands-On + Q&A**
- Each participant uses an AI tool for a task relevant to their work
- Guided evaluation: "Is this output useful? Would you trust it without checking?"
- Open Q&A — honest answers are the rule, not marketing language

**Materials:** AI Reality Check handout (myths vs. facts), guided evaluation worksheet

### Week 2 — Using AI for Your Work

**Objective:** Participants can identify 3 specific tasks in their work where AI could save time and 2 where it would be inappropriate.

**Hour 1 — Industry-Specific Applications**
- Small business: inventory forecasting, customer communication drafting, bookkeeping assistance
- Nonprofit: grant writing drafts, donor communication, program reporting
- Education: lesson plan scaffolding, differentiated instruction, assessment analysis
- Municipal: public records summarization, constituent communication, process documentation

**Hour 2 — Practice Session**
- Each participant works on a real task from their actual work
- Paired exercise: evaluate your partner's AI output (is it accurate? appropriate? ready to use?)
- Introduction to the "accept / reject / modify" framework (simplified AI Audit Log concept)

**Materials:** AI Task Finder worksheet (where AI helps, where it doesn't), accept/reject/modify decision card

---

### Week 3 — Privacy, Security, and Evaluating AI

**Objective:** Participants can identify AI-related security risks and make informed decisions about which AI tools to trust with their data.

**Hour 1 — Security Literacy**
- **Phishing and social engineering:** AI-enhanced scams (voice cloning, personalized phishing, synthetic video)
- **Privacy in AI interactions:** Where your data goes when you use AI tools. What never to type into a chatbot (SSN, passwords, proprietary data, client information)
- **AI-generated misinformation:** Deepfakes, synthetic text, voice cloning. How to verify before sharing.
- **Password and account security:** 2FA, password managers, securing AI tool accounts

**Hour 2 — Informed Consent and Evaluation**
- What questions to ask when your workplace adopts an AI tool:
  - Where does my data go?
  - Who has access to my inputs?
  - Can I opt out?
  - What happens if the AI is wrong?
  - Who is responsible for AI-generated decisions?
- Group exercise: evaluate a real AI tool's privacy policy (simplified reading guide)

**Materials:** AI Security Checklist (print-friendly, one page), AI Tool Evaluation Rubric (5 questions to ask before using any AI tool)

---

### Week 4 — Building Your AI Toolkit

**Objective:** Participants leave with a personal AI action plan — 3 tools they'll use, 2 guardrails they'll follow, and a connection to ongoing learning.

**Hour 1 — Personal AI Workflow**
- Review of best free/low-cost AI tools by category:
  - Text: ChatGPT Free, Claude Free, Gemini
  - Images: Canva AI, Microsoft Designer
  - Data: Google Sheets AI, Excel Copilot
  - Writing: Grammarly, LanguageTool
- Building a personal AI toolkit card (3 tools matched to your work)
- Setting personal guardrails (what you will and won't use AI for)

**Hour 2 — Community of Practice + Next Steps**
- Share your AI toolkit card with the group
- Q&A on anything from the 4 weeks
- Introduction to ongoing resources:
  - Monthly Town Hall (free, virtual or in-person)
  - Ordo Brief newsletter (weekly, free)
  - EverydayAI alumni network (Slack or similar)
- For those interested in deeper learning: overview of workshops and studio (no pitch, just information)

**Materials:** Personal AI Toolkit card (wallet-size, print-friendly), Resource Guide (links, next steps, community connections)

## Connection to Studio Ordo Ecosystem

### Natural Funnel (No Pitch)

```
EverydayAI participant
    → discovers Ordo Brief newsletter (free, weekly)
    → downloads a lead magnet (Spell Book PDF, Context Pack Kit, Scorecard)
    → some attend Town Hall (free, monthly)
    → some explore workshops (paid, corporate budget)
    → rare few inquire about studio apprenticeship
```

**Rule:** We do not sell at EverydayAI events. Week 4 includes an information overview of further learning options. Participants who want to explore paid offerings do so on their own terms, on their own timeline.

### Apprentice Integration
- Level 4 Maestro Candidates co-facilitate EverydayAI sessions as part of Gate Project 8
- This creates a self-sustaining model: the studio produces facilitators for the community program
- Apprentice facilitators gain real teaching experience with real non-technical audiences
- Community participants see Studio Ordo quality firsthand
