## Overview

Studio Ordo's community programs form the growth engine for the business. Free community training builds reputation and pipeline. Corporate training generates revenue. Apprentice graduates emerge from the community. The flywheel compounds.

## Core Principles

1. **Community programs are genuinely free.** Not "free trial." Not "freemium." Free.
2. **Corporate revenue funds community programs.** The model is transparent and stated publicly.
3. **Union pricing.** Corporate packages are published. No hidden fees. No "call for pricing" on standard offerings.
4. **Keith's role is founder/director.** Not professor. Studio Ordo is a business, not a university.
5. **All programs connect to LMS systems.** Events, registrations, and newsletter run through the platform.
6. **Materials are open-licensed.** Community training curricula are published for reuse.
