## How Each Stage Feeds the Next

### Stage 1: Free Community Training → Awareness + Trust

**Input:** EverydayAI 4-week program, Town Hall monthly events
**Output:** Community participants who know Studio Ordo by experience, not advertising

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Word of mouth | "I went to this free AI training. It was actually honest." |
| Partner amplification | Newark community centers, libraries, nonprofits share the program |
| Local media | Free community program is a newsworthy story (university founder gives back) |
| Content generation | Every event produces quotes, data, and stories for the Ordo Brief |

**Key metric:** Community participants per quarter

### Stage 2: Content Pipeline → Email List + Authority

**Input:** Ordo Brief newsletter, lead magnets (Spell Book PDF, Context Pack Kit, Human Edge Scorecard)
**Output:** Growing email list of engaged professionals

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Community → subscriber | EverydayAI participants join the Ordo Brief |
| Lead magnet download | Professionals find Spell Book PDF or Scorecard through search/social |
| Town Hall attendees | Monthly events capture emails of engaged tech professionals |
| Content sharing | Newsletter readers forward to colleagues ("you need to read this") |

**Key metric:** Email list size, open rate, lead magnet downloads

### Stage 3: Corporate Training → Revenue

**Input:** Warm leads from community, newsletter, and referral network
**Output:** Paid corporate engagements (Starter $2K / Professional $5K / Enterprise $10K)

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Community referral | "My friend went to EverydayAI. Can you do something like that for our team?" |
| Newsletter reader → buyer | Engineering manager reads Ordo Brief for 3 months, then books a workshop |
| Assessment-driven | HR/VP downloads Human Edge Scorecard, sees gaps, books team assessment |
| Repeat business | Starter → Professional → Enterprise progression |

**Key metric:** Corporate engagements per quarter, revenue, repeat rate

### Stage 4: Apprenticeship Pipeline → Talent + Sustainability

**Input:** Community participants and corporate contacts who want deeper engagement
**Output:** Studio apprentices who eventually lead community programs

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Community → studio | EverydayAI participant discovers the studio, applies |
| Corporate → studio | Workshop participant's developer wants structured growth |
| Apprentice → facilitator | Level 4 Maestro Candidates co-facilitate EverydayAI (Gate Project 8) |
| Graduate → hire | Career Bridge connects graduates with employer network |
| Graduate → community leader | Experienced graduates lead community programs, reducing Keith's load |

**Key metric:** Studio applications, gate project completions, community facilitation hours

## Flywheel Acceleration Levers

### What Makes the Flywheel Spin Faster

1. **Quality compounds.** Every cohort improves the materials. Year 3 materials are significantly better than Year 1.
2. **Graduates become facilitators.** Level 4 apprentices lead community sessions, scaling capacity without proportional cost.
3. **Content generates leads.** Every EverydayAI session produces newsletter content, social proof data, and testimonial opportunities.
4. **Corporate clients refer.** "We did Studio Ordo training. Our competitor should too." — Wait, no. "My former colleague just became VP at [Company]. They need this."
5. **Newark becomes a case study.** "The city where AI literacy started at the community center" — a story that sells itself.
6. **The email list compounds.** 200 → 800 → 2,000. Each subscriber sees every issue. Conversion is a function of time and relevance.

### What Slows the Flywheel

1. **Quality drops.** Community events that don't deliver real value break trust immediately.
2. **Keith becomes a bottleneck.** If only Keith can deliver, capacity is capped. Training facilitators is critical by Year 2.
3. **Corporate sales without community foundation.** Cold outreach without community reputation is 10x harder.
4. **Overcommitting.** Taking every corporate inquiry before the delivery model is solid produces bad outcomes.
5. **Losing the anti-hype voice.** The moment community participants smell a sales pitch, trust evaporates.
