## How to Read These Maps

Each journey follows the same structure:

1. **Trigger** — What event or need initiates the journey
2. **Awareness** — How they discover Studio Ordo
3. **Evaluation** — How they assess whether Studio Ordo is worth their time/money
4. **Decision** — What pushes them from "interested" to "committed"
5. **Onboarding** — First experience after committing
6. **Active Engagement** — The core of their relationship with Studio Ordo
7. **Outcome** — The measurable change they experience
8. **Advocacy** — How they bring others into the ecosystem

Each stage includes:
- **Persona's inner monologue** (what they're thinking/feeling)
- **Touchpoints** (what they interact with)
- **Platform features required** (what the system must support)
- **Content needed** (what we need to produce)
- **Cialdini principle active** (which influence lever is operating)

## Behavioral Test Scenarios (Derived from Journeys)

These scenarios map directly to journey stages and are ready for Playwright/behavioral spec writing:

### Awareness → Evaluation

```gherkin
Scenario: Engineering director evaluates services page
  Given Marcus visits the services page
  Then he sees published pricing for all engagement types
  And he sees the Team Readiness Assessment preview
  And he sees Keith's credentials with specific numbers
  And he does NOT see "call for pricing" anywhere

Scenario: Ambitious engineer downloads Spell Book
  Given Priya visits the homepage
  When she clicks "Get the Ordo Spell Book"
  Then she enters her email and role
  And she receives the PDF within 60 seconds
  And she is subscribed to the Ordo Brief newsletter
  And she can unsubscribe with one click
```

### Affiliate Lifecycle

```gherkin
Scenario: Affiliate registers and receives materials
  Given Sophia visits the affiliate program page
  When she completes the affiliate registration form
  And she uploads her W-9
  Then she receives a unique QR code with attribution link
  And she can download co-branded business card templates
  And she sees her affiliate dashboard

Scenario: Referral attribution tracks through to commission
  Given Sophia's QR code links to studio-ordo.com/?ref=sophia-rivera
  When a prospect scans the QR code and completes an intake
  Then the intake is attributed to Sophia
  When the intake converts to a $5,000 deal
  And the deal reaches DELIVERED status
  Then a commission ledger row is created for $1,250 (25%)
  And Sophia sees the commission in her dashboard as EARNED
  When the maestro approves the payout
  Then the commission status changes to APPROVED
  And Sophia is paid via the next payout cycle
```

### Apprentice Progression

```gherkin
Scenario: Apprentice submits gate project
  Given Alex is a Level 1 apprentice
  When Alex submits their portfolio site gate project
  Then the maestro receives a review notification
  When the maestro scores the project (minimum 3/4 on rubric)
  Then Alex advances to Level 2
  And Alex's Spell Book shows 15+ accumulated terms
  And Alex's profile shows Level 2 status

Scenario: Apprentice writes monthly field report
  Given Alex is in Month 2 of Level 1
  When Alex writes a field report using the Level 1 prompts
  Then the report is submitted for maestro review
  And selected excerpts are flagged for newsletter use
  And the maestro provides written feedback within 1 week
```

### Community Learner

```gherkin
Scenario: Community member registers for EverydayAI
  Given Maria visits the events page
  When she sees the next EverydayAI session
  Then registration is free
  And no credit card is required
  And the description uses no technical jargon
  When she completes registration
  Then she receives a confirmation with clear logistics
  And she is NOT added to a marketing funnel until she opts in
```
