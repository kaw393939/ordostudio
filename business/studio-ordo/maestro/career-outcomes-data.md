## The Deployment Gap

> "Only 48% of AI projects reach production." — Industry consensus across Gartner, McKinsey, and IDC reports.

This means:
- The bottleneck is not AI capability — it is deployment skill
- Engineers who can ship AI to production (not just prototype) are the scarce resource
- The premium is in evaluation, reliability, and accountability — not in prompting
