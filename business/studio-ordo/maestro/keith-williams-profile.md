# Keith Williams — Maestro Profile

## Short Bio (3 paragraphs — for website, proposals, media)

Keith Williams has spent 23 years teaching engineers to build production software. As a Senior Lecturer at NJIT's Ying Wu College of Computing, he created 8 courses, taught 15 sections per year, and trained over 10,000 students — many of whom now work at Amazon, Google, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and hundreds of other organizations. Some are CTOs. Some are building companies in Newark.

Before academia, Keith served as an AmeriCorps member teaching technology to children in Pittsburgh, then built and led a technology startup as CTO through acquisition by Anthem Ventures. He consulted internationally on software engineering for the government of Zambia, implementing e-government systems and introducing UX design practices. He built one of the first MEAN stack frameworks, which became Showedme.net (a SaaS learning management system), and created the iOS collaboration app Wrkbench. Programming since 1983, when his father — a mainframe systems lead operator for Alcoa — gave him a Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer 2 for Christmas.

Keith founded the BS in Enterprise AI degree program at NJIT and directs the Center for Enterprise AI. Studio Ordo is the independent translation of that work into professional practice — the same intellectual frameworks, the same rigor, adapted for working engineers and teams. His 1,837+ professional connections, two decades of curriculum design, and intensive AI research since late 2022 form the foundation for every Studio Ordo engagement.

## Full Profile

### The Arc

**1983 — A TRS-80 and a father in data centers.** Keith Williams started programming on a Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer 2. His father was a mainframe systems lead operator for Alcoa. He grew up in a data center — not metaphorically.

**AmeriCorps — Teaching before teaching.** Keith served as an AmeriCorps member at an urban after-school youth center in Pittsburgh, teaching computers to children. This is where he discovered that teaching technology was his medium.

**Startup CTO — Building and shipping.** Keith co-founded a technology startup and served as CTO through acquisition by Anthem Ventures. He learned what happens when code meets customers, investors, and deadlines.

**Zambia — International consulting.** Software engineering for the government of Zambia: implementing an e-government system and introducing UX design practices using Axure prototyping. He learned what happens when software meets institutions.

**The MEAN Stack and SaaS.** Keith built one of the first MEAN stack frameworks, which became Showedme.net — a SaaS learning management system. He also created the iOS collaboration app Wrkbench.

**2002 — NJIT.** Keith joined NJIT as an adjunct instructor and built the Web Systems (WIS) program in the Department of Informatics, Ying Wu College of Computing. Over 23 years, he created 8 courses, taught 15 sections per year, and trained 10,000+ students. His graduates work at Fortune 100 companies and lead engineering teams across the northeast.

**Late 2022 — AI, intensively.** Within days of ChatGPT's launch, Keith began using AI tools — not casually, but intensively. Over 2+ years, he built research projects through NJIT capstone courses: advanced ETL pipelines combining LLM and ML techniques for NLP and knowledge graph construction to support RAG workflows.

**2025 — The BS in Enterprise AI.** Keith designed the BS in Enterprise AI degree program — a 4-year curriculum built around 8 irreplaceable human capabilities, with AI tools used from day one. The degree proposal is 49 pages of cross-referenced, citation-backed content produced through the human-AI collaboration model it teaches.

**2026 — Studio Ordo.** The independent platform that translates 23 years of teaching engineers into professional practice. The same intellectual frameworks, the same rigor, adapted for working engineers and teams who need to ship reliably with AI.

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Years teaching engineers | 23 |
| Students taught | 10,000+ |
| Courses created | 8 |
| Sections per year | 15 |
| Professional connections | 1,837+ |
| Years programming | 40+ (since 1983) |
| AI research (intensive) | 2+ years (since late 2022) |

### Where Students Went

Amazon, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, ADP, PSEG, Prudential — and hundreds of smaller companies, startups, and consulting firms. Some are CTOs. Some are senior engineers. Some are building companies in Newark.

### The Portfolio Build

In February 2026, Keith built a complete Swiss-design portfolio website in approximately 10 hours — one evening of focused work. The build involved 200+ AI interactions and 28,000 words of generated content. Lighthouse scores: 100/100 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. A traditional agency would estimate $15,000–$30,000 and 3–4 weeks for equivalent work.

This was not a stunt. It was a demonstration of the Context Pack method — the same approach taught in every Studio Ordo engagement. One person, directing AI agents with precise context, producing professional-grade output with measurable quality.
