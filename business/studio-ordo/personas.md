> write behavioral tests, and guide all marketing and content strategy.

## How to Use This Document

Each persona is a composite based on real market research, 23 years of classroom observation,
and documented career-outcomes data. They are not aspirational fantasies — they represent
the actual people Studio Ordo serves.

**For product:** Derive features by asking "What does this persona need next?"
**For marketing:** Write copy by asking "What would make this persona stop scrolling?"
**For UX:** Validate designs by asking "Can this persona accomplish their goal in under 3 clicks?"
**For tests:** Write behavioral specs by asking "How would this persona describe success?"

Each persona includes:
- **Archetype alignment** (from `influence-strategy.md`)
- **Primary Cialdini lever** — the influence principle that most naturally earns their trust
- **Anxiety center** — what keeps them up at night (people care about money and timing)
- **Success metric** — how *they* measure whether Studio Ordo delivered value

### The Flywheel Connection

Each persona feeds the next:
- **Maria** builds community trust → some discover the newsletter → some attend Town Halls
- **Sophia** refers **Marcus**, **David**, and **Lisa** → earns 25% lifetime commission
- **Marcus/David/Lisa** buy training → their engineers (like **Priya**) experience Studio Ordo
- **Priya** enrolls as **Alex** → progresses through 18 months → graduates
