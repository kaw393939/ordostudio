# Studio Ordo — Brand Guide (Fortune-100 Style)

## 1) Executive summary

**Studio Ordo** is a workshop + training studio that brings **order to AI** in software delivery.

- Primary market: **CTOs / Engineering Managers** buying risk reduction and delivery reliability.
- Secondary market: **individual professionals** seeking real AI capability (not tool tourism).

Studio Ordo is built on a simple premise:
- AI can accelerate engineering.
- Without method, AI amplifies chaos.
- Ordo is method.

## 2) Brand definition

### Brand name
- **Studio Ordo**

### Meaning
- **Ordo** (Latin): *order, arrangement, discipline.*

### Brand promise
- **Bring order to AI in software delivery.**

### Brand mission
- Turn AI from a novelty into a reliable production capability for engineers and teams.

### Vision
- A future where AI-augmented software delivery is measurable, auditable, and repeatable.

### Values (operational)
- **Craft** over shortcuts.
- **Proof** over vibes.
- **Systems** over slogans.
- **Responsibility** over speed-at-all-costs.
- **Teaching** as force-multiplier.

## 3) Positioning

### Positioning statement
For CTOs and engineering leaders who want the speed of AI without the risk, Studio Ordo delivers training and apprenticeship grounded in spec-driven engineering, evaluation gates, and disciplined workflow design.

### Differentiators
- **Engineering-first AI**: specs/tests/evals as the center, not prompts.
- **Measurable outcomes**: cycle time, defect escape, review load, and reliability.
- **Workshop model (bottega)**: learn by shipping, with critique and standards.
- **Anti-hype stance**: protects credibility with executives and senior engineers.

### Competitive alternatives
- Generic “prompt engineering” training.
- Tool-specific tutorials (expires quickly).
- AI evangelism without production safeguards.

## 4) Brand archetypes

### Primary archetype: Sage
- Calm authority, clear method, sober proof.
- Language: precise, structured, non-performative.

### Secondary archetype: Explorer
- Field work, experimentation, discovery — but inside guardrails.
- Language: curious, practical, grounded.

### What we are *not*
- Not a hype machine.
- Not “AI will replace engineers.”
- Not “just ship it and fix later.”

## 5) Audience

### A) CTO / Eng Manager (buyer)
- Jobs-to-be-done:
  - Increase delivery throughput without quality collapse.
  - Create standards for AI use in engineering.
  - Reduce security/compliance surprises.
  - Improve onboarding and team consistency.

- What they fear:
  - Shadow AI practices.
  - Inconsistent code quality.
  - Unverified outputs in production.
  - Vendor lock-in and tool churn.

### B) Individual engineer / professional
- Jobs-to-be-done:
  - Become effective with AI without losing engineering rigor.
  - Build a portfolio of real artifacts (specs, tests, evals, PRs).
  - Learn modern workflows (spec-driven development, evaluation harnesses).

## 6) Proof points (current)

Use these as “trust anchors” across site and sales collateral:
- **20+ years** teaching and building software engineers.
- **10,000+ students** taught.

Optional proof add-ons (when available):
- Case studies with before/after metrics.
- Published talks and curriculum artifacts.
- Testimonials from senior engineers/managers.

## 7) Brand narrative (short forms)

### One sentence
Studio Ordo brings order to AI in software delivery through training, standards, and apprenticeship.

### 30-second pitch
Studio Ordo trains engineers and teams to ship with AI reliably. We combine spec-driven development, testing discipline, and evaluation gates so AI accelerates delivery without increasing production risk.

### 2-minute pitch
Most AI training teaches tools and prompts. Studio Ordo teaches a production method. We start with specs and tests, then layer AI into implementation and review in a way that’s measurable and auditable. For leaders, that means faster delivery with fewer surprises. For individuals, it means real capability — and artifacts that prove it.

## 8) Experience principles

Studio Ordo experiences must feel:
- **Precise** (clear hierarchy, clear next action).
- **Calm** (no chaos UI, no gimmicks).
- **Serious** (proof, standards, artifacts).
- **Inviting** (apprenticeship, field notes, learning path).

## 9) Brand guardrails

- Do not overclaim (“guaranteed”, “always”, “10x”).
- Prefer numbers and artifacts over adjectives.
- Never imply outcomes that depend on customer context without stating assumptions.
