# Studio Ordo — Brand Governance

## 1) Ownership

- Brand owner: Studio Ordo (Keith Williams).
- Implementation owner: LMS 219 engineering.

## 2) Change control

### What requires review
- Changes to brand promise/tagline.
- Changes to primary CTAs.
- Any new colors/typography tokens (should be avoided).
- Claims that imply measurable outcomes.

### How changes are proposed
- Create a short PR note:
  - What changed
  - Why
  - What user impact
  - Screenshots (if UI)

## 3) Proof policy

- Every strong claim must be tied to proof (numbers, artifacts, testimonials).
- If proof is not available, use narrower language.

## 4) Release & rollback

- Prefer feature flags for high-risk UI changes.
- Keep a rollback playbook aligned with `docs/rollback-playbook.md`.

## 5) Versioning

- Treat these docs as a living system.
- Record major shifts in:
  - `docs/release-checklist.md`
  - `docs/rollback-playbook.md`

## 6) Naming consistency

- “Studio Ordo” is always title case.
- “Ordo” may be used as shorthand only when context is already established.
- Avoid splitting the identity across too many names.
