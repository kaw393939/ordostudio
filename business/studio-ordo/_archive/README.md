# Archive (Reference / Not Required For MVP)

This folder is for business documents that are:
- valuable reference,
- not required to operate the production MVP,
- and/or outdated or superseded.

## Rules
- Do not delete documents; archive instead.
- Prefer moving only when links have been updated or the document is clearly standalone.
- If a doc contains authoritative, code-verified truth, it does **not** belong here (it belongs in `system-specs/`).

## What should be archived
Examples:
- old marketing drafts,
- superseded program formats,
- workshop deep content not currently sold,
- historical notes.
