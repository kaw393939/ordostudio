# Studio Ordo — Intellectual Property Collection

## What This Is

This folder contains Studio Ordo's proprietary frameworks — the intellectual foundation that powers every engagement, workshop, and apprentice track. These are not marketing abstractions. They are operational tools used in delivery, taught in workshops, and assessed in the studio.

## The Five Frameworks

| Framework | Document | One-Line Summary |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Human Edge** | [human-edge-framework.md](human-edge-framework.md) | Eight professional competencies AI cannot replace — the capabilities that make engineers irreplaceable. |
| **Context Pack** | [context-pack-method.md](context-pack-method.md) | The four-component operating method for directing AI agents — the meta-skill of the AI era. |
| **Spell Book** | [spell-book-professional.md](spell-book-professional.md) | ~40 named concepts that signal professional competence — compressed vocabulary for engineering leadership. |
| **40/60 Method** | [forty-sixty-method.md](forty-sixty-method.md) | The ratio framework for balancing manual skill-building with AI-directed workflow — a diagnostic tool for teams. |
| **AI Audit Log** | [ai-audit-log-practice.md](ai-audit-log-practice.md) | The accountability practice for documenting every AI interaction — what you accepted, rejected, and why. |

## How They Connect

- **Human Edge** defines the eight capabilities every practitioner should develop. It answers: *what makes you irreplaceable?*
- **Context Pack** is the operating method — the four-component brief that turns vague intent into precise AI direction. It answers: *how do you work with AI agents?*
- **Spell Book** provides the shared vocabulary that makes Context Packs precise and team communication efficient. It answers: *what language do professionals use?*
- **40/60 Method** structures the practice sessions — enough manual work to build judgment, then AI-directed work to build velocity. It answers: *how much should you hand-code vs. delegate?*
- **AI Audit Log** keeps the accountability trail — documenting decisions, rationale, and learning over time. It answers: *how do you prove your judgment?*

## Mapping to Studio Ordo Offers

| Framework | Workshop | Team Program | Advisory | Studio (Apprentice) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Human Edge | Taught as the "why" | Assessed per team member | Diagnostic input | Developed across all levels |
| Context Pack | Practiced in every session | Team adopts as standard workflow | Reviewed for organizational fit | Required artifact at every gate |
| Spell Book | Distributed as handout/PDF | Customized for team domain | Used in reports | Accumulated v1 through v4 |
| 40/60 Method | Structures the session | Calibrated for team maturity | Recommended ratio delivered | Ratio shifts as apprentice advances |
| AI Audit Log | Introduced + practiced | Adopted as team standard | Audited quarterly | Required for every project submission |

## Origin

These frameworks were developed by Keith Williams over 20+ years of teaching engineers and building production systems. They synthesize principles from information theory (Shannon), instructional design (Vygotsky, Sweller, Bruner), systems thinking (Meadows, Conway), and software engineering practice (Brooks, Martin, Beck) — adapted for the AI era.
