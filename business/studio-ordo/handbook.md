# Studio Ordo — Operating Handbook (Fortune-100 Style, Small-Team Edition)

This handbook captures how Studio Ordo operates as a **managed marketplace + apprenticeship + editorial engine**.

Principles:

- **Anti-hype**: proof over vibes.
- **Standardized offers**: union pricing, predictable scope.
- **Adult supervision**: maestro gatekeeping protects clients and apprentices.
- **Auditable operations**: every mutation is logged; money movement is ledgered.

## What this is

- A professional baseline for Keith Williams' LLC to run Studio Ordo.
- A source document for converting strategy → epics → sprint packages.
- The operating manual for the **Modern Software Bottega** model (Maestro, Journeyman, Apprentice, Affiliate).

## The Bottega Model & Commission Structure

Studio Ordo operates as a decentralized guild, not a traditional agency or bootcamp. We have **zero obligation** to hire or place our students. Graduates are independent contractors.

### The Philosophy: The Modern Polymath
We are not trying to solve everyone's problems. We are cultivating the modern polymath—the *Uomo Universale* for the AI era. Our people should be able to work on anything and manage agents to do anything. We teach the meta-skills of the CEO: agentic orchestration, product engineering, and autonomous systems. If AI has all the answers, the Apprentice's job is to ask the right questions through **Disciplined Inquiry**.

### The Hierarchy
1. **The Maestro (Keith Williams):** Sets the architectural vision, defines the "Double Stripping" thesis, and acts as the final quality gate. Secures commissions but does not manage daily trainee execution.
2. **The Journeyman (John):** The operational bridge and partner. Manages commissions, oversees agentic output, and directly supervises the Apprentices.
3. **The Apprentice (Independent Contractor):** Graduates of the 90-day program who have proven their capability. They are assigned overflow work from commissions and execute the 40/60 split under the Journeyman's supervision.
4. **The Affiliate (The Network):** The decentralized sales force (often former students). They generate leads (e.g., at NYC AI meetups) and take a high commission (15-20%) on closed Studio Ordo contracts.

### The Engine
- **Lead Gen:** Affiliates bring in leads.
- **The Sale:** Studio Ordo closes the contract at a premium rate based on the Maestro brand and guaranteed evaluation gates.
- **The Split:** The Affiliate gets their commission, Studio Ordo takes the house margin, the Journeyman takes a management cut, and the Apprentice is paid a contractor rate to execute the work.
