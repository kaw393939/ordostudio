# Studio Ordo — Business & Brand System

This folder contains the **business-facing brand system** for Studio Ordo.

- If you’re building UI, the source of truth for implementation-level tokens/components is:
  - `docs/design-system.md`
  - `docs/icon-map.md`
  - `src/app/globals.css`

## Contents

### Strategy & personas

- `influence-strategy.md` — Cialdini principles + Mark & Pearson brand archetypes, ethically applied.
- `personas.md` — 8 canonical personas with psychology, archetype alignment, and influence mapping.
- `journey-maps.md` — lifecycle journey maps for each persona; feature requirements derived.

### Brand system

- `brand-guide.md` — brand identity, positioning, archetypes, value props, proof points, and narrative.
- `messaging-guide.md` — copy blocks, CTAs, objections, and persuasion ethics.
- `voice-tone.md` — writing voice, tone ladder, and editorial rules.
- `style-guide.md` — visual identity rules mapped to existing site tokens (no new colors/fonts invented).
- `one-page-brand-sheet.md` — single-page cheat sheet distilling the brand guide.
- `governance.md` — how to maintain and evolve the system (approvals, release process, versioning).

### Operations

- `handbook.md` — master index for all operating documents.
- `system-specs/README.md` — canonical, code-verified documentation of the platform as it exists today.
- See `ops/`, `policies/`, `product/`, `roadmap/` for detailed operating docs.

## Non-negotiables

- Studio Ordo messaging is **anti-hype**: clarity, craft, and measurable outcomes.
- Visual system uses existing tokens (see `src/app/globals.css`).
- Persuasion is used **ethically**: truth, proof, transparency; no dark patterns.
