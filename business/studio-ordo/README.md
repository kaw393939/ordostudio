# Studio Ordo — Business & Brand System

This folder contains the **business-facing brand system** for Studio Ordo.

If you are trying to operate or validate the **production MVP**, start here:
- `START-HERE.md`

If you are trying to understand what the software **actually does today**, start here:
- `system-specs/README.md`

- If you’re building UI, the source of truth for implementation-level tokens/components is:
  - `docs/design-system.md`
  - `docs/icon-map.md`
  - `src/app/globals.css`

## The Bottega Model

Studio Ordo operates as a **Modern Software Bottega**. We are a decentralized guild, not a traditional agency or bootcamp.
- **The Maestro (Keith Williams):** Sets the architectural vision and acts as the final quality gate.
- **The Journeyman (John):** The operational bridge and partner who manages commissions and supervises execution.
- **The Apprentice:** Independent contractors (graduates) who execute the 40/60 split under the Journeyman's supervision.
- **The Affiliate:** The decentralized sales network that generates leads for high commissions.

We maintain a strict **zero obligation** policy: we do not promise jobs to students, and graduates operate as independent contractors.

## Non-negotiables
