# Role Readiness Map

## Overview

This document maps each apprentice level to job readiness — specific roles, salary ranges, required portfolio evidence, and skills checklists. The data comes from real job postings, BLS projections, and industry salary surveys.

## Level 2 Complete → Entry-Level AI-Aware Positions

### Eligible Roles
| Role | Salary Range | Key Requirement |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Junior AI Engineer | $80K–$110K | Demonstrates AI workflow discipline, not just usage |
| Junior Full-Stack Developer | $75K–$105K | Full-stack with testing and CI/CD (stands out from bootcamp grads) |
| Quality Engineering Associate | $80K–$100K | Testing expertise + AI Audit Log demonstrates evaluation skills |
| Technical Content Developer | $70K–$95K | Curator Cards + research workflow show writing + AI discipline |

### Skills Checklist
- [ ] HTML/CSS/JavaScript fundamentals (no-framework proficiency)
- [ ] Full-stack development (front-end + API + database)
- [ ] TDD with 100% test coverage on at least one project
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration and enforcement
- [ ] Git workflow (meaningful commits, branching, PRs)
- [ ] AI Audit Log with 20+ entries showing accept/reject/modify reasoning
- [ ] Context Pack v2 (engineering-grade project specification)
- [ ] Failure Mode Analysis (identifies 3+ failure scenarios with mitigations)
- [ ] Incident Response Runbook (tested in drill)
- [ ] Research workflow (CURATOR_NOTES, AGENTS.md, PROMPT_LOG, CLAIMS.md)

### Portfolio Requirements
- 4 deployed projects with live URLs
- GitHub repositories with clean commit histories
- AI Audit Log demonstrating judgment (not just recording)
- At least 1 project with documented failure analysis
- README files written for employer audience

### Differentiator
A Level 2 apprentice can articulate *why* they accepted or rejected an AI suggestion. Most entry-level candidates cannot. The AI Audit Log is the proof.

## Level 3 Complete → Mid-Level AI Engineering Positions

### Eligible Roles
| Role | Salary Range | Key Requirement |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| AI Product Engineer | $110K–$150K | Ship AI-powered features with evaluation and monitoring |
| LLM Application Engineer | $120K–$160K | Build agentic systems with SOLID architecture |
| DevOps / Platform Engineer | $110K–$145K | Infrastructure-as-code, container orchestration, defense-in-depth |
| Data Engineer (AI Focus) | $115K–$150K | Data pipeline with quality assumptions documentation |

### Skills Checklist
- [ ] Everything from Level 2, plus:
- [ ] SOLID principles demonstrated in production code
- [ ] Command pattern, dependency injection, interface segregation
- [ ] Multi-provider AI orchestration (OpenAI + Gemini minimum)
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform)
- [ ] Configuration management (Ansible)
- [ ] Container orchestration (Docker Compose)
- [ ] Edge proxy with automated TLS (Traefik or equivalent)
- [ ] Defense-in-depth security (6-layer model)
- [ ] STRIDE threat modeling
- [ ] AGENT_HANDOFF.md (tested: someone else continued the work)
- [ ] Data Assumptions Document (what data represents and doesn't)
- [ ] Context Pack v3 (infrastructure-grade with SLA and security)
- [ ] Operational checklists (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly)

### Portfolio Requirements
- 6 deployed projects (including infrastructure and agentic system)
- STRIDE threat model with 5+ identified threats and mitigations
- AGENT_HANDOFF.md that has been tested by another person
- Data Assumptions Documents showing epistemic honesty
- Operational runbooks with proven recovery procedures

### Differentiator
A Level 3 apprentice writes an AGENT_HANDOFF.md that a stranger can use to continue the work. Most mid-level engineers cannot produce documentation this effective. The STRIDE threat model shows security thinking that most developers don't develop until year 5+.

### Matched Job Postings (Examples)
- **Morningstar ($145K–$183K):** "Create documentation and handoff artifacts for production teams" — directly maps to AGENT_HANDOFF.md
- **OpenAI ($137K–$250K):** "Safe and effective deployment of AI systems" — maps to defense-in-depth + STRIDE + evaluation
- **WorkWhile:** "Build, ship, and iterate on LLM-backed agentic workflows" — maps directly to the Agentic Orchestration Toolkit

## Level 4 Complete → Senior AI Engineering & Leadership Positions

### Eligible Roles
| Role | Salary Range | Key Requirement |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Forward-Deployed AI Engineer | $140K–$220K | Ship AI to real clients, handle production, present and defend |
| Senior AI Product Engineer | $150K–$200K | Knowledge graphs, HITL, evaluation harnesses |
| AI Solutions Architect | $160K–$250K | End-to-end system design with security and observability |
| Technical Lead (AI) | $180K–$260K | Lead team, communicate to stakeholders, evaluate and ship |
| Independent Consultant | $150–$300/hr | Full maestro rates for independent AI consulting |

### Skills Checklist
- [ ] Everything from Level 3, plus:
- [ ] Knowledge graph design and integration
- [ ] HITL workflows with confidence thresholds and escalation routing
- [ ] Evaluation harness (Retrieval: Recall@k, MRR, nDCG; Generation: groundedness, attribution; System: latency, cost, timeout)
- [ ] Production observability (request tracing, decision logging, cost tracking)
- [ ] Real client engagement (requirements → delivery → satisfaction)
- [ ] Demo Day presentation with evidence-based defense
- [ ] Community AI training delivery (minimum 15 participants)
- [ ] Translation Brief (bridging technical and non-technical audiences)
- [ ] Context Pack v4 (professional-grade with synthesized prior context)
- [ ] 60+ Spell Book terms across 8 domains
- [ ] NPS data from community training event

### Portfolio Requirements
- 8 shipped projects with full documentation
- Real client project with satisfaction data
- Demo Day recording (or presentation deck + Q&A notes)
- Community training event with participant feedback
- Translation Brief with specific analysis of what worked
- Evaluation harness with published metrics and thresholds
- 4 Context Packs showing progressive sophistication

### Differentiator
A Level 4 apprentice has something almost no candidate has: **real evidence of AI judgment at production scale.** The Demo Day recording shows them being asked hard questions and admitting limitations. The community training event shows they can make the complex accessible. The evaluation harness shows they can measure quality, not just ship code.

## AI Premium Data

The market pays a premium for AI-capable engineers:

| Skill | Premium Over Base | Source |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| AI/ML experience | +15–30% | Multiple salary surveys (2024) |
| LLM application engineering | +20–40% | Specialized role postings |
| AI evaluation / responsible AI | +25–50% | Demand exceeds supply significantly |
| Client-facing AI delivery | +30–50% | Forward-deployed roles command highest premiums |

### BLS Projections
- Software developer employment: +17% through 2033 (much faster than average)
- AI-specific roles are a subset with even faster growth
- Deployment gap: 48% of organizations report difficulty deploying AI to production — the bottleneck is people who can ship, not people who can prototype

---

## Career Trajectory

| Timeline | Role | Estimated Compensation |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| Level 2 complete (Month 8) | Entry-level AI-aware engineer | $80K–$110K |
| Level 3 complete (Month 14) | Mid-level AI product engineer | $110K–$160K |
| Level 4 complete (Month 18) | Senior AI engineer / consultant | $140K–$260K |
| 2 years post-Level 4 | Staff engineer / principal / independent | $200K–$400K+ |

### The Studio Ordo Path
Apprentices who complete Level 4 have the option to:
1. **Take employment** — portfolio and network make placement straightforward
2. **Join the Studio** — work as a maestro on Studio Ordo client projects at full rates
3. **Go independent** — use the portfolio, network, and training to launch an independent consulting practice
4. **Combine** — maintain a part-time Studio relationship while employed elsewhere
