# Studio Ordo — Apprenticeship Content

## Overview

This folder contains the structured learning paths, gate projects, and supporting content for the Studio Ordo apprenticeship system. These materials transform a working professional from "person who writes code" into "person who directs AI systems and takes responsibility for the result."

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [learning-paths.md](learning-paths.md) | 4 apprentice levels with clear gates and progression criteria |
| [gate-projects/](gate-projects/) | 8 detailed project specifications — the work that proves readiness |
| [apprentice-journey.md](apprentice-journey.md) | "Alex" narrative — month-by-month progression from Level 1 to Level 4 |
| [field-report-prompts.md](field-report-prompts.md) | Structured reflection prompts for each level |
| [role-readiness-map.md](role-readiness-map.md) | Maps apprentice levels to job readiness and salary data |

## Design Principles

1. **Gate projects produce real portfolio artifacts, not exercises.** Every deliverable is something an employer or client would review.
2. **The progression compresses a 4-year university arc into 12–18 months.** This is possible because apprentices are working professionals, not students learning foundational literacy.
3. **Human Edge capabilities are the spine.** Technical skills accumulate around the 8 capabilities — not the other way around.
4. **The 40/60 ratio shifts as competence grows.** Level 1 is ~90% manual. Level 4 is ~30% human / 70% AI. The human percentage shrinks because the human contribution becomes more valuable, not less.
5. **Context Packs and the Spell Book are the connective tissue.** Every gate project requires a Context Pack. The Spell Book grows with each level.

## Onboarding a New Apprentice

1. Administer the Team Readiness Assessment (baseline)
2. Assign Level 1 gate projects
3. Set up Context Pack v1 template
4. Begin AI Audit Log on day 1
5. Schedule first field report at end of month 1
6. Assign maestro mentor for weekly check-ins
