# Gate Project 1 — Professional Portfolio Site

## Level
1: Apprentice (Month 1)

## Human Edge
Disciplined Inquiry

## Overview
Build a professional portfolio website from scratch — HTML, CSS, JavaScript. No templates, no frameworks, no component libraries. Type everything manually. The constraint is the pedagogy: muscle memory, pattern recognition, and the discipline to build before reaching for tools.

## Learning Objectives
- Navigate the terminal with confidence (cd, ls, mkdir, touch, git)
- Write valid, semantic HTML without relying on AI generation
- Style a responsive layout with CSS (no frameworks)
- Add interactive behavior with vanilla JavaScript
- Deploy a live site to a public URL
- Write a professional README that frames the work for an employer

## Technical Requirements
- Valid semantic HTML5 (passes W3C validation)
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop) using CSS only — no Bootstrap, Tailwind, or other frameworks
- Minimum 3 pages: Home, About/Bio, Projects (even if placeholder content)
- JavaScript interaction: at least one meaningful interactive element (navigation toggle, theme switch, form validation)
- Accessibility: proper heading hierarchy, alt text on images, keyboard-navigable
- Deployed to a public URL (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)
- Version control: minimum 10 meaningful commits showing iterative development

## Deliverables
1. Live deployed portfolio website
2. GitHub repository with clean commit history
3. README.md with: project description, technologies used, deployment URL, what you learned
4. Context Pack v1 (first attempt — project brief + success criteria)

## Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| HTML Quality | 25% | Semantic, valid, accessible, well-structured | Valid and semantic, minor accessibility gaps | Valid but not semantic, missing alt text or heading hierarchy | Invalid HTML, no semantic elements |
| CSS & Responsiveness | 25% | Polished responsive design, consistent spacing, professional appearance | Responsive, minor visual inconsistencies | Partially responsive, significant layout issues on mobile | Not responsive, layout broken |
| JavaScript | 15% | Meaningful interaction, clean code, error handling | Working interaction, minor code quality issues | Interaction present but buggy or incomplete | No JavaScript or non-functional |
| Professional Framing | 20% | README is employer-ready, commits tell a story, Context Pack thoughtful | README complete, commits reasonable, Context Pack present | README minimal, patchy commits, Context Pack incomplete | No README or Context Pack |
| Deployment & Git | 15% | Live URL, 10+ meaningful commits, clean history | Live URL, 8+ commits, some messy history | Live URL but fewer than 5 commits | Not deployed or no version control |

# Context Pack — Portfolio Site

## Project Brief
I am building a professional portfolio website to showcase my work as a Studio Ordo apprentice.

**Goal:** [What should this site accomplish?]
**Audience:** [Who will look at this?]
**Constraints:** [No frameworks, must be responsive, accessible]
**Success criteria:** [How will I know this is done?]

## Domain Context
[What do I know about professional portfolios? What makes a good one?]

## Evaluation Criteria
- Valid HTML (W3C)
- Responsive (test on mobile and desktop)
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, alt text, heading hierarchy)
- Deployed and live
- README written for an employer

## Prior Context
[What have I built before? What am I building on?]
```

## What "Exemplary" Looks Like
A portfolio site that you would send to a hiring manager without embarrassment. Clean, professional, responsive, accessible. The README explains not just what you built but what you learned. The commit history shows iteration — not a single commit dump. The Context Pack demonstrates that you thought about the problem before you started typing.

## Estimated Time
40–60 hours over 4 weeks

## Resources
- MDN Web Docs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- W3C HTML Validator
- Chrome DevTools (responsive testing)
- Studio Ordo Spell Book v1 terms
