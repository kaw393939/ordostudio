# Gate Project 3 — Design Curator Cards

## Level
2: Journeyman (Month 4–5)

## Human Edge
Resilience Thinking (research rigor) + Problem Finding (autodidactic loop)

## Overview
Produce 3 museum-quality content cards about a design history topic using a complete AI workflow. The deliverable is small on purpose — 3 cards, ~300 words total. **The process is the point.** This project teaches the complete AI collaboration workflow that will be used for every project going forward: research before prompting, constrain the AI, verify every claim, critique with a named expert lens.

## Learning Objectives
- Execute the autodidactic research loop: Orient → Map → Vocabulary → Evidence → Synthesize
- Build an AGENTS.md file that constrains AI behavior for a specific domain
- Maintain a PROMPT_LOG documenting prompt iterations and outcomes
- Verify every factual claim with primary sources (CLAIMS.md)
- Apply Named Expert Critique — select a historical authority and critique through their lens
- Ship museum-quality writing under strict word constraints

## The Autodidactic Loop

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| Orient | Skim broadly, identify the landscape | CURATOR_NOTES.md — initial research |
| Map | Build concept map of relationships | Concept map in CURATOR_NOTES.md |
| Vocabulary | Extract domain-specific terms | Vocabulary list for AGENTS.md |
| Evidence | Find primary sources (museums, archives, original publications) | Source list in CLAIMS.md |
| Synthesize | Write in own words under constraints | 3 curator cards |

## Technical Requirements
- **3 Curator Cards** on assigned design topics, each containing:
  - 80–120 words of museum-label-quality body text
  - 5 vocabulary tags (domain terms, not vibes)
  - 2 real example links (museums, archives, original publications — not Wikipedia)
  - 1 "Not to be confused with" sentence
  - 1 Accountability Note with source verification status
- **Workflow Documentation:**
  - CURATOR_NOTES.md — research thinking before prompting
  - AGENTS.md — reusable AI instructions with vocabulary constraints and banned word lists
  - PROMPT_LOG.md — record of prompts sent, outputs received, decisions made
  - CLAIMS.md — verification log for every factual claim
- **Code Quality:** Clean HTML/CSS, accessible, deployed, minimum 5 meaningful commits
- **Expert Critique:** Select a historical figure relevant to the topic, run their "lens" on the cards, document changes made

## Deliverables
1. 3 deployed curator cards (HTML/CSS)
2. CURATOR_NOTES.md, AGENTS.md, PROMPT_LOG.md, CLAIMS.md
3. Expert Critique documentation (who, what lens, what changed)
4. Reflection: identify one specific AI claim you challenged with evidence
5. Context Pack v2 (adds architecture patterns, testing, code review checklist)

## Available Topic Sets
- **Set A:** Bauhaus (1919–1933), Swiss Style (1950s–1970s), New Wave Typography
- **Set B:** Arts & Crafts Movement, Art Nouveau, Art Deco
- **Set C:** De Stijl, Constructivism, Suprematism
- Maestro may assign other topic sets based on apprentice interest

## Named Expert Critique Options (by topic)
- Walter Gropius (Bauhaus)
- Josef Müller-Brockmann (Swiss Style)
- Armin Hofmann (Swiss Style)
- Wolfgang Weingart (New Wave)
- April Greiman (Digital New Wave)
- David Carson (Grunge Typography)
- William Morris (Arts & Crafts)
- Or propose your own with maestro approval

## Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Card Content | 30% | Museum tone, precise word count, domain vocabulary, real sources | Good tone, meets word count, vocabulary present, sources valid | Acceptable writing, word count off, generic vocabulary | Poor writing, no vocabulary discipline, no sources |
| Verification | 20% | CLAIMS.md thorough, all links working, honest confidence ratings | Most claims verified, links working, confidence noted | Some verification, broken links, thin confidence assessment | No CLAIMS.md or unverified claims |
| Workflow Docs | 15% | Genuine exploration in CURATOR_NOTES, specific/reusable AGENTS.md, detailed PROMPT_LOG | Complete docs, reasonable specificity | Docs present but thin, AGENTS.md generic | Missing docs |
| Expert Critique | 15% | Critique ran, changes documented, reflection shows learning | Critique ran and applied, minimal documentation | Critique attempted, not clearly applied | No expert critique |
| Code Quality | 10% | Clean HTML/CSS, accessible, deployed, 5+ meaningful commits | Deployed, clean code, 5 commits | Deployed, some code quality issues | Not deployed or poor code |
| Reflection | 10% | Identifies specific AI claim, challenges with evidence, articulates lesson | Identifies claim and challenge, thin lesson | Surface-level reflection | No reflection |

## What "Exemplary" Looks Like
Cards that a museum curator would approve for a public exhibit. The AGENTS.md file is specific enough that a different person could use it to produce similar quality results on a different topic. The CLAIMS.md is honest — some claims are marked "verified," some "partially verified," some "unable to verify." The PROMPT_LOG shows iteration, not a single prompt.

## Estimated Time
40–60 hours over 4–6 weeks

## Resources
- Studio Ordo Spell Book: autodidactic loop, token discipline, Named Expert Critique, AI Audit Log pattern
- Context Pack Method guide (v2 template)
- Museum collection databases (MoMA, V&A, Cooper Hewitt, Design Museum)
