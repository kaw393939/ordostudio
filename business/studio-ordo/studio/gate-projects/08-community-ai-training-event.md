# Gate Project 8 — Community AI Training Event

## Level
4: Maestro Candidate (Month 17–18+)

## Human Edge
Translation

## Overview
Design and deliver a community AI training session using the EverydayAI format. The audience is not engineers — they are small business owners, nonprofit staff, teachers, and municipal employees. If you can teach AI to people who have never opened a terminal, you understand it well enough to lead engineers. Teaching is the ultimate test of understanding.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply the Feynman technique: explain complex concepts to non-expert audiences
- Design curriculum using cognitive load theory (limit new concepts per session, scaffold complexity)
- Build hands-on materials that work for diverse skill levels
- Deliver live training to a real audience (minimum 15 participants)
- Collect and analyze participant feedback
- Write a Translation Brief that bridges technical and non-technical worlds
- Demonstrate that you can make the complex accessible without making it wrong

## Technical Requirements

### Curriculum Design
- **3-hour session** following the EverydayAI format:
  - Hour 1: The Landscape (what AI is, what it cannot do, honest acceleration data)
  - Hour 2: The Practice (40/60 framework simplified, hands-on with real tasks)
  - Hour 3: The Conversation (concerns, accountability principle, resources)
- **Audience analysis:** Written profile of the target audience (who they are, what they fear, what they need)
- **Cognitive load management:** Maximum 3 new concepts per hour segment, scaffolded from familiar to unfamiliar
- **Profession-specific prompt templates:** At least 3 task templates tailored to the audience (e.g., teacher: lesson plan; nonprofit: grant language; business: marketing copy)

### Materials
- Presentation slides or visual aids (no wall-of-text slides — visual communication)
- Hands-on exercise instructions (printable, works without internet as backup)
- Prompt template handouts by profession
- Take-home resource card (laminated, business-card size — what to use, where to start)
- Facilitator notes (what to say, when to pause, how to handle common questions)

### Dry Run
- Deliver the session to Studio Ordo peers (dry run audience of 5–10)
- Collect feedback on: jargon, assumptions, pacing, resonance
- Revise based on feedback before live delivery

### Live Event
- Minimum 15 real participants (not Studio Ordo staff)
- Registration managed through the LMS events system
- Participant NPS collected post-event
- At least 3 participants share-out what they produced during the session

### Translation Brief
A written document that:
- Explains the core technical concepts covered in the session
- Describes how each concept was translated for a non-technical audience
- Identifies which metaphors, analogies, and examples worked (and which didn't)
- Provides recommendations for future sessions

## Deliverables
1. Curriculum document (3-hour session plan with learning objectives, timing, activities)
2. Audience analysis (who, fears, needs, win conditions)
3. Presentation materials (slides or visual aids)
4. Hands-on exercise instructions
5. Prompt templates by profession (minimum 3)
6. Take-home resource card
7. Dry-run feedback and revision notes
8. Live event delivery (minimum 15 participants)
9. Participant NPS scores and feedback summary
10. Translation Brief
11. Impact assessment (what participants produced, what they said, what changed)
12. Context Pack v4 (Translation variant: audience analysis, pedagogical frameworks, comprehension data)

## Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Curriculum Design | 25% | 3-hour session well-structured, cognitive load managed, progression clear | Session structured, pacing reasonable, minor flow issues | Session present but pacing off or too much content per segment | Session plan unclear or inappropriate for audience |
| Materials Quality | 20% | Professional, visually clear, prompt templates useful, take-home card valuable | Materials complete, mostly professional, templates useful | Materials present but text-heavy or generic | Materials missing or unusable |
| Live Delivery | 25% | Confident, clear, responsive to room, handles questions well, participants engaged | Good delivery, mostly clear, handles most questions | Delivery adequate but jargon slips in or loses the room | Poor delivery, audience disengaged |
| Translation Brief | 15% | Insightful analysis of what worked and didn't, specific recommendations for future sessions | Brief present, reasonable analysis, some recommendations | Brief thin, surface-level analysis | No Translation Brief |
| Impact | 15% | NPS 50+, participants produced real artifacts during session, 3+ share-outs | NPS 30+, most participants produced something, 2+ share-outs | NPS positive, some participant output | Negative NPS or no participant output |

## What "Exemplary" Looks Like
A session where participants who walked in anxious about AI walk out with a real artifact they produced themselves — a lesson plan, a grant draft, a marketing email. The Translation Brief identifies specific moments: "When I said 'large language model,' I saw confusion. When I switched to 'a prediction engine that guesses the next word,' the room nodded." The NPS is above 50 and at least one participant asks when the next session is.

## Feynman Technique Checklist
Before the live event, test yourself:
1. Can you explain what a large language model does in one sentence without jargon?
2. Can you explain why AI makes mistakes using a metaphor your grandmother would understand?
3. Can you explain the 40/60 framework using an example from the audience's profession?
4. If someone asks "Will AI take my job?", can you give an honest, evidence-based answer in 60 seconds?

If you cannot do all four, you are not ready to deliver. Revise and practice.

## Estimated Time
80–120 hours over 8–10 weeks (including dry run and live event)
